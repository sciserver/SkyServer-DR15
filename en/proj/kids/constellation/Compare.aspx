<p class="kids">One group saw a horse; the other group saw a dove. What do 
you see?</p>

<p class="kids">Now, trade papers with someone in the other group. Now can you see 
what they saw? (You might have to study the stars carefully to see it.)</p>

<p class="kids">This activity shows what ancient people did when they saw the stars. You can 
think of yourself as a member of an ancient culture. When you looked at the sky and saw those 
stars, you saw a dove or a horse. Whenever you looked at those stars, that's what you saw.</p>

<table align=left><tr>
  <td><img src="images/horse.jpg"></td>
</tr></table>

<p class="kids">The other group was like another ancient culture. They saw the other shape (horse or dove) - then every time they looked at those stars, they saw that shape.</p>

<p class="kids">Of course, there aren't <i>really</i> doves or horses in the sky - just stars. 
The ancient people saw the patterns in the stars that they had always seen, just like 
you saw the pattern you had seen from your handout.</p> 

<p class="kids">Now that you understand what constellations are, let's look at a real 
constellation. Click Next to see Orion the Hunter.</p>
