      <p class="kidsheader">Drawing Tips</p>
           
      <p class="kids"><b>1) Get Ready:</b> Use clean, white paper for your 
      drawing. Computer paper works well. Get some pencils. Use colored 
      pencils if you want to, but regular pencils will work. Use hard 
      pencils (such as 2H or 3) for stars and softer pencils (such as 1 or 2) 
      for cloudlike areas. Make sure you have an eraser to fix 
      your mistakes. Then, get the object you need in your 
      telescope or monitor.</p>

      <b>2) Look:</b> Spend a few minutes just looking at 
      the object. What is its shape? How big is it? How bright is it? When 
      you are ready, draw the object's general outline.</p>

      <b>3) Draw:</b> Look at the object again. What 
      details do you see? Draw them. Begin with the biggest, clearest 
      details. Work your way down to the smaller, fainter details. Make sure 
      you show each part of the object in the right place on your drawing. 
      Draw the stars around the main object, with the brightest first. 
      Just touch your pencil to the paper for the faintest ones.</p>
      
      <p class="kids"><b>4) Check:</b> Compare your drawing to what you 
      see in the telescope or monitor. Erase and redraw to fix any mistakes. 
      To make the cloudy parts look more realistic, try smudging the drawing 
      a little with your finger.</p>

      <p class="kids">I hope these tips will help you become 
      interested in drawing the night sky like I have. I would be 
      happy to offer any further help, and to see the results of your 
      work.</p>
