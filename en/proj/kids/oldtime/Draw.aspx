<p class="kids">When I was an astronomer, we had telescopes, but we didn't have 
cameras or computers. We couldn't just take a picture through our telescopes. 
To record observations, or to show them to our friends, 
we had to draw what we saw.</p>

<p class="kids">Even today, many people draw what they 
see through their telescopes. The picture to the right shows a drawing and a 
photograph of the same galaxy.</p>

In this project, you are going to pretend that you are 
an "old time astronomer" like me. Cameras have not been invented yet, so 
you have to record your observations by drawing. Your computer monitor 
will be like your telescope. You will look at a picture and try to 
draw what you see.</p>

<p class="kids">Before you begin drawing, get some advice from a modern 
astronomer who still draws what he sees through his telescope. Click 
Next to meet him.</p>
