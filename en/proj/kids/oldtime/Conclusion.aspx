      Did you enjoy drawing the objects? You have now learned a little about 
      what astronomy was like in my time. If you have a parent that owns a 
      telescope, you can try doing astronomy just like I did. Look through 
      the telescope's eyepiece, and draw what you see. Try it!</p>

      <p class="kids">Today, astronomers rarely look through telescopes with their eyes. 
      They almost always use a camera to record the data they want.</p>
      <p class="kids">The SDSS telescope pictures you saw were taken 
      with a large digital camera. The camera is shown to the right.</p>

          camera to take pictures of objects through a telescope instead of 
          trying to draw what you see?</p></td>

     If you or your school has a scanner, try scanning your pictures into a 
      computer. You can then "invert the colors" to make all the black areas white and 
      the white areas black. If you did your drawing on a white paper, now you will have a black sky! 
      To learn how to invert colors, see the Help menu of your photo editing program.</p>
