<h1>Try This!</h1>

<p>With a compact disc (CD), you can see the visible spectrum of light. Hold the CD 
under a bright light, and slowly tilt it back and forth. You should see lines of color 
radiating out from the center. If you look closely, you can see the order of the 
visible spectrum (sometimes reversed) in the color patterns.</p>

<p>The CD stores information in thousands of tiny grooves on its surface. When white 
light hits the grooves, the light bends to travel around the grooves. Different 
wavelengths bend by different amounts (the amount also depends on the angle at which 
the light hits the CD). Since different wavelengths bend by different amounts, the 
mixed-wavelength light hitting the CD spreads into a visible spectrum, with red at 
one end and violet at the other.</p>
