        <p>Generally, stars have different colors because they have different 
        temperatures. However, as you learned in the last question, stars 
        are not perfect thermal sources. For instance, a 
        certain type of star called a carbon star has a very red color. Carbon in the 
        star's atmosphere absorbs much of its blue light, making the cool star 
        appear even redder than it should for its temperature.</p>
        <p>A star's color can usually give you a good idea of its temperature, 
        but it is always a good idea to double-check by measuring the star's spectrum 
        with a spectrograph. In fact, whenever the SDSS sees an extremely 
        red star, software automatically targets the star for follow-up 
        measurements with the spectrograph.</p>

        <p>You can see some of these unusual stars in the graph to the right, 
        a color-color diagram for all the stars in the SDSS's Early Data Release. 
        The black dots are normal "main sequence" stars. 
        All the other stars were flagged by their unusual colors and selected 
        for follow-up spectral measurements.</p>
        <p>Most of the objects that lie outside the black main sequence 
        are unusual stars, galaxies, or quasars. Although classifying objects 
        by color is not a foolproof method, you can learn a lot about an 
        object by looking only at its colors.</p>
        <p>Astronomers use colors to classify many objects including 
        stars, galaxies and quasars. They can use colors to estimate the 
        spectral types of stars, the types of galaxies, to sort asteroids into 
        different classes, and to estimate the distances to galaxies and 
        quasars. In the Research Challenge below, you will use color to 
        answer your own questions about the sky.</p>

          <td width="100%"><p><strong>Research 
          Challenge</strong>. Think of a question you would like to answer by 
          studying the colors of objects in the SDSS database. You may decide 
          to answer one of the questions below, or you may think of your own. </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>How do the colors of the 
            hottest stars vary? Of the coolest?</li>
            <li><p>Can you use a color-color 
            diagram to identify giant or dwarf stars?</li>
            <li><p>Can you distinguish different 
            types of galaxies based on their colors?</li>
            <li><p>Can you identify quasars in a 
            field of stars using only their colors?</li>
            <li><p>Can you identify different 
            types of quasars based on color?</li>
            <li><p>Can you identify different 
            types of asteroids based on their colors?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once you have identified a 
          question to answer, use SkyServer's tools to look at the SDSS 
          database. Find several (at least 
          20-30) of the objects you are interested in and record their 
          magnitudes. Calculate some or all of the object's colors (u-g, g-r, r-i, 
          and/or i-z). Make a color-color diagram or examine the spectra of the 
          objects (for those that have spectra available). Make whatever graphs 
          you need to understand your question.</p>
          When you have finished your 
          research project, 
          <a href="mailto:raddick@pha.jhu.edu?subject=Colors research">E-mail us 
          your results</a>. <p>Send us the 
          question you were trying to answer, the IDs of the objects you 
          examined, and whatever graphs or charts you used in your research. 
          We'll look at all the projects we receive, and we'll put the best of 
          them up on this site!</p>
