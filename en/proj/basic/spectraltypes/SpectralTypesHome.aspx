	<p>When astronomers look through their telescopes, they see billions of stars. How do they make sense of all of them?</p>

	<p>Classification lies at the foundation of nearly every science. Scientists develop classification systems based
	on the patterns they see. For example:</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Biologists classify plants and animals into groups based on their structure</i></li>
	  <li>Geologists classify rocks and minerals by their origins</li>
	  <li>Chemists classify compounds by what elements they contain</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Astronomers are no
	different. We classify planets by their composition (rocky planets or gas giants), galaxies by their 
	shape (spiral, elliptical or irregular), and stars by their spectra.</p>
	
	<p>Classifying star spectra was a key
	step for astronomers in discovering how stars work. Thus, in astronomy as well as other sciences, the seemingly 
	ordinary step of classifying things eventually yields critical insights into our world.</p>


     <h1>Before You Start</h1>

	<p>To do the activities in this project, you will need to understand how spectra are formed, the relationship
	between the shape of a star's thermal spectrum and the star's temperature, and what 
	<span class="vocabulary">absorption lines</span> are.</p>
