<p>Now, use the connection between temperature and line strength to see what you can understand about stars. 
Look back at the classes you wrote in the table in Explore 7, and answer the questions below.</p>

      <table class=question width=600 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0>
        <tr>
          <td><p><strong>

          Question 9</strong>. What two classes of stars have the strongest Ha lines? Are these the hottest stars? The coolest? How hot are these stars?</p>
	</td></tr></table>

<p></p>

      <table class=question width=600 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0>
        <tr>
          <td><p><strong>

          Question 10</strong>. Which class of stars is the hottest? Which class of stars is the coolest? How strong are the H&alpha; lines for these two classes of stars?
</p>
	</td></tr></table>

<p></p>

<p>Take another look at this chart that you saw earlier:</p>

<img src="images/atomictransitions.jpg" alt="A graph of atomic transition energy jumps. It shows arrows going up from a lower energy level to a higher energy level. Three transitions are shown, including the Balmer series involving n=2." />

      <table class=question width=600 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0>
        <tr>
          <td><p><strong>

          Question 11</strong>. Which transition corresponds to the H&alpha; lines that you have been using to classify?</p>

        <p>What energy state do the electrons in the stars with strong Ha lines start in (before making their transitions to other states)?</p>
	</td></tr></table>

<p></p>

      <table class=question width=600 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0>
        <tr>
          <td><p><strong>

          Question 12</strong>. Take another look at the chart above. What energy levels might you expect the electrons in the hydrogen of hotter stars 
          to start in? What energy level might you expect to see in the electrons of hydrogen in a colder star? Why might these hot and cold stars 
          show very weak H&alpha; lines?</p>
	</td></tr></table>

<p></p>

      <table class=question width=600 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0>
        <tr>
          <td><p><strong>

          Question 13</strong>. A hydrogen atom with an electron in n=1 exists as neutral hydrogen; a hydrogen atom with electrons in a higher energy 
          level loses an electron to become a hydrogen ion. What classes of stars have a lot of neutral hydrogen? How hot are these stars? What 
          classes of stars have a lot of ionized hydrogen? How hot are these stars?</p>

      <table class=question width=600 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0>
        <tr>

          <td><p><b>Question 14</b>. Stars are composed primarily of hydrogen. But among the <a href="spectra.aspx" target="spectra">stars you 
          classified</a>, stars 1, 4, and 5 have other spectral lines that are much more prominent. If hydrogen is 
          the main component of stars, why isn't H&alpha; the most prominent absorption line in every star?</p> </td>

          <td><p><b>Question 15</b>. The accepted ordering for spectral classes among astronomers is OBAFGKM. 
          You may have learned the classes with the phrase "Oh, be a fine girl/guy, kiss me." Why do the classes 
          appear in this order?</p>
          
          <p>Why do you think astronomers decided to re-order the spectral classes instead of just redefining what  
          the letters meant (that is, changing what a class "A" star was)?</p> </td>
