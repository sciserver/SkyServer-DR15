      <h1>Moving Objects</h1>
      
      <p>Most of the objects the SDSS sees are so far away that they do not appear to 
      move. Most stars in the sky move so slowly, you would not 
      notice any significant change over your whole lifetime.</p>
      <p>But some objects are much closer to Earth, so they move much 
      more quickly across the night sky. The planets move across the sky - our word 
      "planet" comes from the Greek word for "wanderer." If you look carefully, you 
      can see the planets move from night to night. With a large 
      telescope, you can see the planets move right before your eyes!</p>
      
      <img src="images/jupiter.gif" align="right">
      
      <p>The planets are the largest, most famous moving sky objects. But when our 
      solar system formed, not all the matter combined to form 
      planets. If a planet tried to form near Jupiter, Jupiter's enormous gravity would 
      rip it apart. So the Solar System has a lot of leftover debris, mostly between the 
      orbits of Mars and Jupiter.</p>
      <p>The first asteroid was discovered in 1801 by Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi. At 
      first, he thought he had discovered a comet. But after he calculated its orbit, 
      he realized that he had found a totally new type of object between Mars and 
      Jupiter.</p>

      <h1>Asteroids</h1>
      
      <p>Most asteroids are small pieces of rock a few kilometers across. 
      The largest is named Ceres and is about 900 km across. But large asteroids 
      are rare: there are only 26 known asteroids larger than 
      200 km across. The total mass of all the asteroids is probably 
      about the mass of the Earth's moon.<img border="0" src="images/asteroid.gif" width="282" height="210" align="right"></p>
      <p>Asteroids are so close that they move across the sky 
      quickly. The SDSS telescope takes pictures through 5 filters, one after the 
      other. 
      If the asteroid is close enough, it appears to move between filters. 
      You can see a very fast moving asteroid in the picture at the right. 
      The asteroid moved as the picture was taken in each 
      filter.</p>
      <p>Notice how the red and green streaks are close together and the blue 
      streak is farther away. Although the SDSS takes images through five filters, 
      astronomers use only three to make the color image you see. Color computer images are made 
      by combining red, green, and blue pictures. To make SDSS pictures,
      the i filter makes the red picture, r filter makes the green picture,
      and the g filter makes the blue picture. (Note: the assignment of picture colors 
      to filters is not related to the color of light the filters see.)</p>
      
      <p>Look at the picture below, which shows the SDSS camera. Look at the labels in the 
upper left corners of the center squares. You can see that 
      the r and i filters are close 
      together and the g filter is at the other end. Therefore, more time 
      passes between the red and blue images than between the green and red images. 
      The asteroid moves farther in this time. This is why the blue streak is so far 
      from the other streaks in the picture above.</p>

      <p>Most asteroids move much more slowly than the one above. Most do not 
      move much as a picture is being taken, and most do not even move significantly 
      between the r and i filters. But since 
      the g filter is at the other end of the camera, the asteroid will move 
      much more by the time the g filter takes a picture of that area of sky. 
      For such a slow-moving asteroid, 
      you will see what appears to be a yellow dot (the combination of red and 
      green) next to a blue dot!</p>

      <p>The animation to the right shows what happens when the SDSS's filters scan a part of 
      sky with a slow-moving asteroid. The asteroid is the brown dot moving across the animation. 
      The animation shows the camera's r, i, and g filters sweeping 
      across the sky. (In reality, it works the opposite - the cameras stay still and 
      the sky moves during the night.) The camera takes a picture of the asteroid through 
      the r and i filters (which are next to one another), leaving a yellow dot. 
      When the g filter scans the asteroid, the asteroid has moved; 
      it shows up as a blue dot in its new place.</p>
      
      <p>In the last frame of the animation, the asteroid is removed, leaving only the 
      image that would be seen by the SDSS. So this animation tells you how to find asteroids - just look for a yellow 
      dot and a blue dot close together!</p>
