      <p>Most galaxies fit one of the three previously described types, but 
      about 3% of the galaxies we observe are very different. </p>
      <p>These so-called "irregular galaxies" do not have a lot of common features. Many of them are the 
      results of galaxy collisions or near misses. One type of irregular 
      galaxy is called a "starburst galaxy." Starburst galaxies shine 
      brightly as many new stars are born in a short period of time.</p>
      <p>Irregular galaxies are usually found in groups or clusters, where 
      collisions and near-misses between galaxies are common. In a few 
      irregular galaxies, astronomers can't figure out why they look 
      so strange!</p>
      <p>Irregular galaxies are denoted by the letters Irr.</p>
