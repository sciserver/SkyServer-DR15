      <h1>Galaxy Collisions</h1>
      <p>Many galaxies are members of groups or clusters. 
      Since groups and clusters contain so many galaxies relatively close 
      together, it should not be surprising that 
      galaxies sometimes collide with each other. In fact, the Milky 
      Way Galaxy is colliding with the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy right now 
      (see the <a href="../../../sdss/discoveries/discoveries.aspx#halos">
      SDSS First Discoveries</a> for more information). 
      Although galaxy collisions are common, stars in each galaxy are so far apart that 
      collisions between stars are very rare.</p>
      <p>Even if galaxies don't actually collide, though, they can still affect 
      one another. When two galaxies pass close to one another, the 
      force of gravity they exert on one another can cause both galaxies to 
      bend out of shape. Both crashes and near misses between galaxies are referred to as 
      &quot;interactions.&quot;</p>

      <p>At the right, you can see two galaxies interacting. You can see they are 
      being distorted by the gravitational interaction between them. Can you 
      imagine what they might have looked like before they interacted?</p>
      <p>When two galaxies interact, clouds of gas inside each galaxy may 
      become compressed. Compressing the clouds can cause them to collapse 
      under their own gravity, turning into stars. This process can lead to 
      a burst of star formation in interacting galaxies, leaving a 
      new generation of stars in a galaxy where normal star formation may have 
      ceased long ago.</p>
          <!--
      <p>Galaxy collisions take hundreds of millions of years, so we can't watch 
      them happen. Instead, we use computer simulations to show us what 
      would happen if two galaxies collided in a certain way. If you are 
      interested in learning about galaxy collisions, you can use a 
      <a href="supplemental.aspx">web-based simulation tool</a> to model 
      them.</a></p>-->
