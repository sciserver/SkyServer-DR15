      <h1>Spiral Galaxies</h1>
      <p>Not 
      surprisingly, spiral galaxies look like spirals, with long arms winding 
      toward a bright bulge at the center. But be careful - if you looked at a spiral 
      galaxy from the side, you could mistake its shape for a circle, and 
      so you'd have to use other criteria to learn it was a spiral.</p>
      <p>If you can clearly see the spiral shape, the galaxy is called a 
      "face-on spiral." If you instead see the galaxy from the side, 
      it is called an "edge-on spiral." You can recognize edge-on 
      spiral galaxies because you can see their bright central bulges. 
      Face-on and edge-on spiral galaxies 
      aren't really any different; they only look different because of 
      the angle from which you see them.</p>
      <p>Some spiral galaxies have arms that are wound 
      tightly, while other galaxies have very loosely-wound arms. The 
      difference between tightly and loosely wound spirals is a genuine 
      difference between the galaxies, and can be used to classify spirals.</p>
      <p>About 77% of the observed galaxies in the universe are spiral galaxies. Our own 
      galaxy, the Milky Way, is a typical spiral galaxy. The images below 
      show three other good examples.</p>

      <p>Some spiral galaxies have a bright line, or bar, running through them. 
      These are called "barred spiral galaxies." The image below shows a 
      barred spiral galaxy. Galaxies without a bar are 
      simply called "spiral galaxies."</p>

      <p>Spiral galaxies are further classified by how tightly their spiral arms 
      are wound. A galaxy with very tightly wound arms, such the left galaxy 
      in the list above, would be called "type a." galaxy A "type b" galaxy 
      has more loosely wound 
      arms. A "type c" galaxy (such as the middle one above) has very loosely 
      wound arms. What type do you think the barred spiral to the right would be?</p>
      <p>The arms of a spiral galaxy have lots of gas and dust, and 
      they are often areas where new stars are constantly forming. The bulge 
      of a spiral galaxy is composed primarily of old, red stars. 
      Very little star formation goes on in the bulge.</p>

      types.</p>
