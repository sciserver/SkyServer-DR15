<p>NOTE: the Universe project recently changed. The <a href="../universe_original/">older version</a> is still available.</p>

<p>Where do you live? Your home or your school has an address: a street, a city or town, and a country. When someone wants to send you a letter, they give your address, so that your mail carrier knows the letter should go to you. For example, the address of the astronomy building at Johns Hopkins University is:</p>

<p>3701 San Martin Drive<br>
Baltimore, Maryland 21218<br>
United States of America</p>

<table class=question width=600 cellpadding=5>
  <tr>
     <td><p><strong>Question 1</strong>. What is your school's address?</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>But does this address <i>really</i> describe where you are? Imagine extending the address out to bigger and bigger divisions, until it becomes a "cosmic address" that includes your continent, planet, galaxy, and universe. So the "cosmic address" of the Johns Hopkins astronomy building would be:</p>

<p>3701 San Martin Drive<br>
Baltimore, Maryland 21218<br>
USA<br>
North America<br>
Earth<br>
The Solar System<br>
The Milky Way Galaxy<br>
The Universe</p>

<table class=question width=600 cellpadding=5>
  <tr>
     <td><p><strong>Question 2</strong>. What is your school's cosmic address?</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The last step of the cosmic address is the largest division: the universe. The universe is actually everything and everywhere. Every star and every galaxy we see is part of the same universe. The universe is a really big place!</p>
