      <p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is not the first effort to map the night 
      sky. Ancient astronomers made maps of the night sky relying on 
      nothing more than their own eyes, meticulously writing down their results.
      </p>
      <p>Technology has improved considerably in the 20th century. Fifty 
      years ago, the Palomar Observatory All Sky Survey (POSS) was completed. Today, in 
      addition to the SDSS, many other all-sky maps are being made. 
      Most of these maps look at the sky with different parts of the electromagnetic 
      spectrum than the SDSS. Different wavelengths of light convey 
      different information about celestial objects, and so give us a more complete 
      understanding of them.</p>
      <p>In this project, you will learn about some other sky surveys 
      that are currently underway, and you will compare them to the SDSS. You will 
      see how the data from the different surveys complement each other and give 
      us a more complete understanding of the universe.</p>
