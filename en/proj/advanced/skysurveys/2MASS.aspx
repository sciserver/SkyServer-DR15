      <h1>Other Parts of the Electromagnetic Spectrum</h1>
      <p>Visible light is only one type of electromagnetic radiation. You 
      have probably heard of many other types as well: radio waves, 
      microwaves, infrared (heat) radiation, ultraviolet, x-rays, and 
      gamma rays. The only difference between all 
      these types of radiation is the radiation's wavelength. Our eyes happen to be 
      sensitive to a certain section of the electromagnetic spectrum - 
      a wavelength of about 5000 Angstroms <br>(5 x 10<sup>-7</sup> m), the range 
      we call visible light. This part of the spectrum is also the peak of the 
      Sun's thermal radiation curve - our eyes are best adapted to detect sunlight!</p>
      <p>The SDSS is not strictly a visible survey, because it extends slightly 
      into the ultraviolet and slightly into the infrared. Today, other astronomy 
      projects are surveying the sky using different parts of the electromagnetic 
      spectrum</p>

      <p>One such survey is the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), which uses two 1.3 meter 
      telescopes, one in Arizona and one in Chile, to map the entire sky in the 
      infrared wavelength band, at a wavelength of about 2 microns (1 micron = millionth of a meter). 
      Cool objects, such as small dwarf stars, give off most of their thermal 
      radiation as infrared light. Therefore, 2MASS can see these cool 
      objects, which are invisible to visible-light surveys like SDSS.</p>
      <p>Scientists from 2MASS are releasing their data on the web just like 
      SDSS scientists are. 2MASS currently has about half the sky in its data release.
      </p>
      <p>Like SDSS, 2MASS produces its color images by combining pictures 
      taken through three different filters. 2MASS's filters (called the J, H, and 
      K filters), see radiation at 1.25 microns, 1.67 microns, and 2.17 microns in the 
      infrared part of the spectrum. When you call up an image in 2MASS's web 
      interface, you will see the raw images in those three filters.</p>
      <p>Several objects in SkyServer's Famous Places list  
      are also visible in the 2MASS survey. Let's look at some images from 2MASS and 
      see how they differ from SDSS images.</font></p>
