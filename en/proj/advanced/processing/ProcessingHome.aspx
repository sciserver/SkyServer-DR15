      <h1>Image Processing</h1>
      <p>A lot of people don't realize all the work that goes into astronomical 
      research. Astronomy is much more than just taking a picture with a 
      telescope. Frequently, the picture needs to 
      be processed to bring out details, compared to other pictures, and adjusted 
      to make color images. </p>
      <p>In this project, you will retrieve some of the individual images from 
      SDSS data. You will combine them to form color images, 
      you will manipulate the images to bring out bright or faint features, 
      and you will &quot;flip&quot; images to look for changes in them, such as 
      asteroids or supernovae.</p>
      <p>But first, let's see what images are and how astronomers look at them.</p>
