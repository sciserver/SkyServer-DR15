      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>You now know a great deal about what galaxies are, what they look like, and how 
      they affect one another. But you can also study one more question: how do 
      galaxies evolve through time? Hubble tried to solve this problem: he 
      thought that galaxies evolved to the right on the tuning fork diagram. 
      He was mistaken. Do you think you can figure out the answer to the problem 
      that stumped Hubble?</p>

      <h1>Galaxy Evolution</h1>
      <p>This section will take a lot of time and effort, but it gives you the 
      opportunity to solve the problem that Hubble couldn't solve! The Research Challenge below 
      will guide you through your study. Do this section on your own, and take your 
      time. Have fun with it. When you finish, 
      <a href="mailto:raddick@pha.jhu.edu?subject=Galaxy evolution">E-mail us</a> your 
      diagrams and an explanation of what you found, We'll look at all 
      the results we receive, and we'll put the best work up on this site!<p>

      The galaxy cluster you looked at in this project, Abell 2255, is at redshift 
      0.081. By looking at different redshifts, you look at different distances 
      away from Earth (see the <a href="#hubblelink" onclick="window.open('../hubble')">Hubble 
      diagram</a> project for more information). Because the speed of light is finite, 
      when you look at larger distances, you are looking at things as they were in 
      the more distant past. So by looking at galaxy clusters of different 
      redshifts, you can see if galaxies have evolved over time.</p>
      
      <p>One easy way to tell if galaxies have changed is to see if their colors have 
      changed. The Research Challenge guides you in making a color-color diagram of galaxies at 
      different redshifts. Can you think of other ways to study galaxy evolution?</p>

        <tr>
          <td><p><strong>Research Challenge.</strong> Make color-color diagrams for 
          galaxies at a variety of redshifts. Look at the percentage of 
          early and late galaxies as a function of redshift. Are there more 
          spirals now than there were in the past? Or are the more ellipticals 
          now than in the past? The table below lists some galaxy clusters and their 
          redshifts. Can you see the colors change due to the redshift?</p>

          <p><p>Search for these clusters using 
          whatever tools you find useful. Large astronomical databases 
          like <a href="http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu" target="offsite">NED</a> 
          and <a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/Simbad" target="offsite">SIMBAD</a> will 
          help you find some information on these clusters. You can enter their names into NED or 	  SIMBAD to find their positions in the sky. Some clusters have SDSS 
          data, but for some, you will have to look at other online data sources like 
          the <a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu" target="offsite">Chandra X-Ray Observatory</a>.</p>
          
          <p>After you get your images and data, you will need to eliminate 
          foreground and background galaxies to get a true look 
          at galaxies in the cluster. The redshifts listed above will help you with this.</p>
          
          <p>This is a tough research challenge, and it would make a good choice for a 
          project for Science Fair or Intel Science Talent Search. Good luck!</p>
