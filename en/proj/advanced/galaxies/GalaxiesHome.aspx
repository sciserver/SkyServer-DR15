      <h1>Galaxies</h1>
      <p>At the turn of the 20th Century, a great debate was raging in  
      astronomy. The debate concerned faint, fuzzy objects called "nebulae." 
      Some astronomers believed nebulae were small clusters of stars in our own galaxy. 
      Others saw some of them as vast, distant collections of stars, some larger than the 
      Milky Way itself.</p>
      <p>Finally, in 1924, American astronomer Edwin Hubble measured the distance 
      to what was then called the Andromeda Nebula. He found it to lie 
      over 2 million light 
      years from Earth. It was the first object to be recognized as 
      another galaxy.</p>
      <p>Hubble's discovery totally changed our view of the universe. The 
      already vast distances between stars were dwarfed by the incomprehensible 
      distances between galaxies. The universe was suddenly a much larger 
      place than anyone had ever imagined.</p>
      <p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has found more than 100 million galaxies so far. In this lesson, you will learn about those galaxies: how to 
      classify them, what their important characteristics are, and how 
      scientists think they evolve.</p>
