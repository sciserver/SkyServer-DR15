      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>You have now seen H-R diagrams for many different star systems. 
      H-R diagrams can tell you about the ages of star clusters. For 
      instance, a cluster with a lot of blue giants is very young, because those stars 
      burn out very quickly. A typical middle age cluster has most of its stars 
      on the main sequence. An older cluster has a lot of red giants. 
      As the cluster ages even further, you see an increasing number of white 
      dwarf stars.</p>

          Find a cluster of stars that intrigues you. You may find a few 
	  others on SkyServer, but you should look at other data sources as well. 
          Good places to look include the <a target="offsite" href=
          "http://www.rssd.esa.int/SA-general/Projects/Hipparcos/skyplot.html">
          Hipparcos database</a>, <a target="offsite" href="http://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss_form">
          The Palomar Observatory Sky Survey</a>, the <a target="offsite"

          another data source you find online.</p>

	  <p>Create an H-R Diagram for your star cluster. Deduce as 
          much as you can about the age and distance of the cluster by studying its stars.</p>
