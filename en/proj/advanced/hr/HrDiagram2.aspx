      <h1>A More Complete H-R Diagram</h1>
      <p>So, do you think the sample was biased? If so, you are right. 
      When you look at the brightest stars in the night sky, you tend to 
      see the largest, hottest, and most luminous stars. Of the 26 brightest stars, 
      nearly all are much larger and brighter than average.</p>
      <p>Your goal should be to make a complete H-R diagram - one that will show 
      all the major types of stars, and roughly how many stars of each type the 
      universe contains. Making an H-R diagram with the brightest stars didn't work, 
      because the diagram contained too many bright stars. You need to try 
      another approach.</p>
      <p>Next, you should make an H-R diagram using the nearest stars 
      rather than the brightest. This diagram will tell us what the stars closest to 
      the Sun are like.</p>

          5.</strong> What is the advantage of looking at the nearest stars rather than 
          the brightest? Do you think the diagram for the nearest stars will look 
          different from the diagram for the brightest stars? 
          If so, how?</p></td>
