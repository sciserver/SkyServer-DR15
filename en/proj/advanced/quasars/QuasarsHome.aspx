      <p>One of the principal goals of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is to find 
      the most distant objects ever observed. The light from these 
      distant objects has taken billions of years to reach us. So when we look at them, 
      we are seeing them as they appeared billions of years ago. 
      We are effectively looking backward in time. Looking at these objects 
      can tell us about the early history of the universe.</p>
      <p>But at such enormous distances, the only objects we can see at all are 
      the very brightest objects. 
      In this project, you will learn about the most distant, brightest objects in the 
      universe: quasars. You will learn what they are, what provides their 
      enormous power, and what they can tell us about the early universe.</p>
