      In 1936, an amateur astronomer named Grote Reber built a radio telescope in 
      his backyard. His was the first telescope ever built specifically to 
      receive radio waves from the sky. Over the next several years, he pointed his telescope all over the 
      sky, and discovered many new sources of radio waves. One of the sources he found, 
      Cygnus A, would prove to change the course of modern astronomy.</p>
      <p>Fifteen years later, in 1951, astronomers Walter Baade and Rudolph Minkowski 
      found the object that created Cygnus A's radio emissions. They used the 200-inch 
      visible-light telescope on Mount Palomar in California to find an unusual-looking 
      galaxy. But when they looked at the spectrum of the galaxy, they found an even 
      greater surprise.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Cygnus A turned out to be a galaxy with a redshift of 0.057. This 
      redshift measurement put it over 700 million light years from Earth, the 
      most distant object yet observed. For Reber to detect its radio source 
      from 700 million light years away, Cygnus A had to be the most intense 
      radio source ever seen.</p>

      <p>As the years progressed, astronomers found more radio sources that 
      corresponded to distant galaxies. Eventually, they started to find radio sources 
      that appeared to correspond to stars! Stars are not a strong 
      source of radio waves, so astronomers knew they were seeing something very 
      unusual.</p>
      <p>Let's take a look at some of these unusual objects.<p>&nbsp;</td>
