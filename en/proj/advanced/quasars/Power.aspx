      <h1>The Power Source of Quasars</h1>
      <p>Quasars are by far the brightest objects in the universe. 
      When astronomers first calculated the energy output of quasars, many of 
      them didn't believe anything could emit that much energy. Some astronomers 
      started looking for other explanations. Many people proposed 
      that the redshifts did not indicate distance and were due to other 
      causes. But further research eventually ruled out the alternative 
      theories, leading most astronomers to conclude that quasars really are the most 
      distant and luminous objects in the universe.</p>
      <p>There are very few energy sources that produce enough energy to power a quasar. 
      The possible source that best fits the observed properties of quasars is 
      a supermassive black hole.</p>
      <p>A black hole is a region of space from which nothing can escape, not 
      even light. Small black holes result from the deaths of very massive 
      stars. The black holes at the centers of quasars have masses of 
      millions or even billions times our Sun's. Although the mass of a typical 
      quasar black hole is very large, its radius is only about as large as our solar 
      system. No one knows how these supermassive black holes come about; their origin 
      is the subject of intense research.</p>

      <p>At the center of a quasar, the black hole is surrounded by a large, 
      rotating cloud of gas. As the gas falls into the black hole, it is 
      heated up to millions of degrees. The gas emits thermal radiation 
      due to its enormous heat. This thermal radiation spans the spectrum, making 
      the quasar bright in the visible spectrum as well as x-rays.</p>
      <p>There is a limit as to how bright a quasar can be, called the Eddington 
      limit, which depends on the mass of the black hole. If 
      too much gas falls into the black hole at once, the gas heats up and 
      creates pressure. This pressure slows down the flow of gas, keeping 
      the luminosity of the quasar below the Eddington limit.</p>
      <p>One of the most important facts about quasars is that they are all very 
      distant from us. The closest quasar is about 800 million light years 
      away. Therefore, we can conclude that there are no quasars in the 
      universe today and the last quasar disappeared about 800 million years 
      ago.</p>
      <p>Where did the quasars go? No one can say for sure. Given 
      their power source, however, it is most likely that they simply ran out of 
      fuel. The black holes eventually consumed all the gas and dust in 
      the disk surrounding them, so the quasars ceased to shine. </p>
      <p>Now, let's analyze some of the quasars found by the SDSS.</p>
