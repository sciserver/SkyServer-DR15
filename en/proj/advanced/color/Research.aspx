<h1>Color in Astronomy Research</h1>

<p>In this project, you have learned how to quantify color, how to interpret color as 
resulting from temperature, and how to test your interpretations using color-color 
diagrams. Now, you are ready to use the SDSS data to do actual astronomy research using 
colors. As you go through this research, you will be looking at stars and galaxies that 
no one has ever looked at before.</p>

<table class=rchallenge width=600 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0><tr>
<td><p><strong>Research Challenge</strong>. Think of a question you would like to answer by 
studying the colors of objects in the SDSS database. You may use one of the questions 
below or think of your own.

<UL>
<LI><p>How do the colors of the hottest stars vary? Of the coolest?
<LI><p>Can you use a color-color diagram to identify giant or dwarf stars?
<LI><p>How do Population I and Population II stars differ? Can you identify any other 
populations of stars from a color-color diagram?
<LI><p>Can you distinguish different types of galaxies based on their colors?
<LI><p>Can you identify quasars in a field of stars using only their colors?
<LI><p>Can you identify different types of quasars based on color?</ul>

<p>Once you have identified a question to answer, look at the SDSS database. Find several 
(at least 20-30) of the objects you are interested in and record their magnitudes. 
Calculate some or all of the object's colors (u-g, g-r, r-i, and/or i-z). Make a color-
color diagram or examine the spectra of the objects (for those that have spectra 
available). Make whatever graphs you need to understand your question.</p>

<p>When you have finished your research project, <a href="mailto:raddick@pha.jhu.edu?subject=Colors research">E-mail 
us your results</a>. Send us the question you were trying to answer, the 
Object ID numbers of the objects you examined, and whatever graphs or charts you used 
in your research. We'll look at all the projects we receive, and we'll put the best 
of them up on this site!</p></td></tr></table>
