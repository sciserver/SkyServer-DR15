<h1>Did You Know?</h1>

<p>The human eye has a peak sensitivity of about 5000 Angstroms, meaning the wavelength 
of light we can see most clearly is 5000 Angstroms. The Sun gives off the largest 
percentage of its light at about 5300 Angstroms. Our eyes are perfectly evolved to see 
the light that the Sun gives off!</p>
