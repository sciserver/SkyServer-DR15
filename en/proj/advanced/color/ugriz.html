<p><font color=yellow>The image on the right shows the sensitivity of the CCD 
chips in SDSS's five filters as a function of wavelength. The image shows two 
curves: the top curve is for the chips in a vacuum, the bottom curve is for the 
chips looking through the Earth's atmosphere.</font></p>

<p><font color=yellow>The image shows that the filters are less sensitive when 
looking through Earth's atmosphere. It also shows that the filters overlap 
slightly - some of the same wavelengths of light are seen by the u and g filters, 
for example.</p>
