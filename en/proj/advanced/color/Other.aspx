<p>The color-color diagram you made in Explore 7 and 8 showed stars far above the 
plane of the Milky Way. But 
when you look up in the night sky, every star you see is in the Milky Way. Stars 
in the planes of galaxies are different from stars above and below the planes. 
Astronomers call the stars in the galactic planes "Population I" stars and stars 
outside galactic planes "Population II" stars. Population II 
stars are older and redder than Population I stars. If you repeated your diagram 
from Explore 7 and 8 with Population I stars instead, you would see more stars lying 
along the main trend.</p>

<table class=question width=600 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0><tr>
<td><p><strong>Question 11.</strong> SDSS was designed primarily to look at other galaxies, 
so most of the survey is far above or below the plane of the Milky Way. But SDSS is still able to see quite a few Population I 
stars. Where in the survey is the best place to look for these stars?</p>

<p>Planets in our solar system and dust between stars both radiate as nearly perfect thermal 
sources. However, both are very cold compared to stars - planets have temperatures 
of about 300 K (27 C) and dust grains have temperatures of about 30 K (  -243 C). Because 
they are so cold, planets and dust grains emit very little thermal radiation. The peak 
wavelength of this radiation is far into the infrared wavelength range.</p>

<p>Galaxies are collections of millions or billions of stars, along with surrounding gas 
and dust. Because the stars in a galaxy may be thermal or non-thermal sources, and 
because they have a wide range of temperatures, galaxies can not be thought of as thermal 
sources with a single temperature.</p>

<p>If most of the stars in a galaxy are blue, the galaxy will appear generally blue. If 
most of the stars are red, the galaxy will appear generally red. The general color 
of a galaxy can tell astronomers something about what types of stars the galaxy contains.</p>

<p>However, the interpretation of galaxy color is complicated by two factors. First, 
interstellar dust in other galaxies absorbs light, and the dust absorbs light more 
easily at shorter wavelengths. Because interstellar dust absorbs short-wavelength light 
from galaxies, the light that reaches Earth is redder than the light the 
galaxies emitted.</p>

<a name="hubble"></a>
<p>Second, the color of a galaxy is changed by how fast it is moving. When a galaxy moves 
away from Earth at high speed, the wavelengths of the light waves it emits are stretched, 
appearing more red (see the <a href="../hubble">Hubble 
diagram</a> project for more information). Galaxies moving away quickly have more 
"redshift," and thus appear more red. Because redshift increases with greater distance, 
astronomers can use galaxy color to make a three-dimensional map of the universe.</a>

<h1>Quasars</h1>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Quasars are the size of our solar system, but they may emit as much light as a hundred galaxies. 
They are thought to be hot gas spiraling into a massive black hole at the center 
of a galaxy. The gravity from the black hole heats the gas, and the gas emits both 
thermal and non-thermal radiation.</p>

<p>The image of a quasar looks just like the image of a star; they were given the 
name "quasar" because they are "quasi-stellar objects." However, the spectra of quasars 
look very different from the spectra of stars. The hot gas in quasars emits in
X-ray wavelengths as it falls into the black hole, and quasars are so distant that 
their spectra are highly redshifted. 
Because quasar spectra are so different from stellar spectra, quasar colors also look 
different. If you look at the colors of all pointlike objects in the sky, you can figure 
out which are stars and which are more likely quasars.</p>

<h1>The Universe</h1>

<p>The universe as a whole glows with very dim thermal radiation. This radiation comes from 
a nearly perfect thermal source at T = 3 K (-270 C), only three degrees above absolute 
zero. The peak wavelength of the universe's thermal radiation is in the microwave area of 
the spectrum, longer than visible or infrared light.</p>

<a name="hubble2"></a>
<p>Astronomers interpret the "cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation" as the radiation 
emitted by early universe, soon after the big bang fifteen billion years ago. The 
CMB has cooled to 3 K as the universe has expanded. The discovery of the CMB 
radiation in 1963 was one of the biggest pieces of evidence that convinced 
astronomers of the big bang theory (see the <a href="../hubble">Hubble diagram</a> project 
for more information).</p>
