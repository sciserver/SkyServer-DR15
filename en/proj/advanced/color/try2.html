<h1>Try This!</h1>

<p>Take two identical flashlights. In a dark room, mark a spot on the floor. Place 
one flashlight one meter away from the spot and the other flashlight 1.58 meters 
away from the spot. Make sure you can see both beams clearly from the spot you 
marked, and make sure the beams take the same angle to your eyes. Turn on both flashlights.</p>

<p>Stand on the spot you marked on the floor and look at the two flashlight beams. 
The nearer one will be almost exactly one magnitude brighter than the farther one.</p>
