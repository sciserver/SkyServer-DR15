      <h1>Correlations to Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education</h1>
      <p>The Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education is a report, 
      originally published in 1993 by the American Association for the 
      Advancement of Science (AAAS), that listed what students should know about 
      scientific literacy. The report listed facts and concepts about science 
      and the scientific process that all students should know at different 
      grade levels.</p>
      <p>The report is divided and subdivided into different content areas. 
      Within each subarea, the report lists benchmarks for students completing 
      grade 2, grade 5, grade 8, and grade 12. The table below shows which 
      benchmarks are met by which sections of the Hubble Diagram project.</p>
      <p>The left column lists the sections of the project. The right column 
      lists all benchmarks that are at least partially discussed by that 
      section. Content headings are listed as Roman numerals, subheadings as 
      letters, grade levels by numbers, and specific points by numbers after the 
      hyphen. For example, benchmark IA8-2 means the second benchmark for eighth 
      grade students in the first content area, first subarea. All benchmarks 
      met by the Colors project are listed below the table</p>

      <p><b>Standards</b></p>
      <p><b>IA5-1</b>. Results of similar scientific invesitgations seldom 
      turn out exactly the same. Sometimes this is because of unexpected 
      differences in the things being investigated, sometimes because 
      of unrealized differences in the methods used or in the circumstances 
      in which the investigation is carried out, and sometimes just because 
      of uncertainties in observations. It is not always easy to tell which.</p>
      <p><b>IA8-1</b>. When similar investigations give different results, the 
      scientific challenge is to judge whether the differences are trivial or 
      significant, and it often takes further studies to decide. Even with 
      similar results, scientists may wait until an investigation has been 
      repeated many times before accepting the results as correct.</p>
      <p><b>IA12-1</b>. Scientists assume that the universe is a vast single 
      system in which the basic rules are the same everywhere. The rules may 
      range from the very simple to the extremely complex, but scientists 
      operate on the belief that the rules can be discovered by careful, 
      systematic study.</p>
      <p><b>IB5-1</b>. Scientific investigations may take many different 
      forms, including observing what things are like or what is happening 
      somewhere, collecting specimens for analysis, and doing experiments.</p>

<p><b>IB8-1</b>. Scientists differ greatly in what phenomena they study and how they 
go about their work. Although there is no fixed set of steps that all scientists 
follow, scientific investigations usually involve the collection of relevant evidence, 
the use of logical reasoning, and the application of imagination in devising 
hypotheses and explanations to make sense of the collected evidence.</p>
      
      <p><b>IB8-2</b>. If more than one variable changes at the same time in an 
      experiment, the outcome of the experiment may not be clearly attributable 
      to any one of the variables. It may not always be possible to prevent 
      outside variables from influencing the outcome of an investigation (or 
      even to identify all of the variables), but collaboration among 
      investigators can often lead to research designs that are able to deal 
      with such situations.</p>
      <p><b>IB12-1</b>. Investigations are conducted for different reasons, 
      including to explore new phenomena, to check on previous results, to test 
      how well a theory predicts, and to compare different theories.</p>
      <p><b>IB12-2</b>. Hypotheses are widely used in science for choosing what 
      data to pay attention to and what additional data to seek, and for guiding 
      the interpretation of the data (both new and previously available).</p>
      <p><b>IB12-3</b>. Sometimes, scientists can control conditions in order to 
      obtain evidence. When that is not possible for practical or ethical 
      reasons, they try to observe as wide a range of natural occurrences as 
      possible to be able to discern patterns.</p>
      <p><b>IC8-6</b>. Computers have become invaluable in science because they 
      speed up and extend people's ability to collect, store, compile, and 
      analyze data, prepare research reports, and share data and ideas with 
      investigators all over the world.</p>
      <p><b>IC8-7</b>. Accurate record-keeping, openness, and replication are 
      essential for maintaining an investigator's credibility with other 
      scientists and society.</p>
<p><b>IIIA5-2</b>. Technology enables scientists and others to observe things 
that are too small or too far away to be seen without them and to study the 
motion of objects that are moving very rapidly or are hardly moving at all.</p>   
      <p><b>IIIA8-2</b>. Technology is essential to science for such purposes as 
      access to outer space and other remote locations, sample collection and 
      treatments, measurement, data collection and storage, computation, and 
      communication of information.</p>
      <p><b>IVA5-5</b>. Stars are like the sun, some being smaller and some 
      larger, but so far away that they look like points of light.</p>
      <p><b>IVA8-1</b>. The sun is a medium-sized star located near the edge of 
      a disk-shaped galaxy of stars, part of which can be seen as a glowing band 
      of light that spans the sky on a very clear night. The universe contains 
      many billions of galaxies, and each galaxy contains many billions of 
      stars. To the naked eye, even the closest of these galaxies is no more 
      than a dim, fuzzy spot.</p>
      <p><b>IVA8-2</b>. The sun is many thousands of times closer to the earth 
      than any other star. Light from the sun takes a few minutes to reach the 
      earth, but light from the next nearest star takes a few years to arrive. 
      The trip to that star would take the fastest rocket thousands of years. 
      Some distant galaxies are so far away that their light takes several 
      billion years to reach the earth. People on earth, therefore, see them as 
      they were that long ago in the past.</p>
      <p><b>IVA12-1</b>. The stars differ from each other in size, temperature, 
      and age, but they appear to be made up of the same elements that are found 
      on the earth and to behave according to the same physical principles. 
      Unlike the sun, most stars are in systems of two or more stars orbiting 
      around one another.</p>
      <p><b>IVA12-2</b>. On the basis of scientific evidence, the universe is 
      estimated to be over ten billion years old. The current theory is that its 
      entire contents expanded explosively from a hot, dense, chaotic mass. 
      Stars condensed by gravity out of clouds of molecules of the lightest 
      elements until nuclear fusion of the light elements into heavier ones 
      began to occur. Fusion released great amounts of energy over millions of 
      years. Eventually, some stars exploded, producing clouds of heavy elements 
      from which other stars and planets could later condense. The process of 
      star formation and destruction continues.</p>
      <p><b>IVA12-3</b>. Increasingly sophisticated technology is used to learn 
      about the universe. Visual, radio, and x-ray telescopes collect 
      information from across the entire spectrum of electromagnetic waves; 
      computers handle an avalanche of data and increasingly complicated 
      computations to interpret them; space probes send back data and materials 
      from the remote parts of the solar system; and accelerators give subatomic 
      particles energies that simulate conditions in the stars and in the early 
      history of the universe before stars formed.</p>
      <p><b>IVD8-1</b>. All matter is made up of atoms, which are far too small 
      to see directly through a microscope. The atoms of any element are alike 
      but are different from atoms of other elements. Atoms may stick together 
      in well-defined molecules or may be packed together in large arrays. 
      Different arrangements of atoms into groups compose all substances.</p>
      <p><b>IVF8-1</b>. Light from the sun is made up of a mixture of many 
      different colors of light, even though to the eye the light looks almost 
      white. Other things that give off or reflect light have a different mix of 
      colors.</p>
      <p><b>IVF8-2</b>. Something can be &quot;seen&quot; when light waves emitted or 
      reflected by it enter the eye - just as something can be &quot;heard&quot; when 
      sound waves from it enter the ear.</p>
      <p><b>IVF8-5</b>. Human eyes respond to only a narrow range of wavelengths 
      of electromagnetic radiation - visible light. Differences of wavelength 
      within that range are perceived as differences in color.</p>
      <p><b>IVF12-3</b>. Accelerating electric charges produce electromagnetic 
      waves around them. A great variety of radiations are electromagnetic 
      waves: radio waves, microwaves, radiant heat, visible light, ultraviolet 
      radiation, x rays, and gamma rays. These wavelengths vary from radio 
      waves, the longest, to gamma rays, the shortest. In empty space, all 
      electromagnetic waves move at the same speed - the &quot;speed of light.&quot;</p>

      <h1>Correlations to NCTM Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</h1>
      <p><i>Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</i> was released in 
      2000 by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The standards, a 
      collaboration between education researchers and school mathematics 
      teachers, lists what concepts students should understand, and what skills 
      they should possess, at different stages of their mathematics education.</p>
      <p>The report is divided and subdivided into ten different content areas. 
      Within the first six areas, the report lists benchmarks for students 
      completing grade 2, grade 5, grade 8, and grade 12. The table below shows 
      which standards are met by which sections of the Colors in Astronomy 
      project.</p>
      <p>The left column lists the sections of the project. The right column 
      lists all standards that are at least partially discussed by that section. 
      Content headings are listed as Roman numerals, subheadings as letters, 
      grade levels as numbers, and specific points by numbers after the hyphen. 
      For example, standard IA8-2 means the second benchmark for eighth grade 
      students in the first content area, first subarea. Content areas VI 
      through X, which concern skill processes in mathematics, are not divided 
      into subareas or grade levels. All standards met by the Hubble diagram 
      project are listed below the table.</p>
