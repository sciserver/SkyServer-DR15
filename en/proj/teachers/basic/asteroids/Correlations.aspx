      <h1>Correlations to Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education</h1>
      <p>The Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education is a report, 
      originally published in 1993 by the American Association for the 
      Advancement of Science (AAAS), that listed what students should know about 
      scientific literacy. The report listed facts and concepts about science 
      and the scientific process that all students should know at different 
      grade levels.</p>
      <p>The report is divided and subdivided into different content areas. 
      Within each subarea, the report lists benchmarks for students completing 
      grade 2, grade 5, grade 8, and grade 12.</p>
      <p>Content headings are listed as Roman numerals, subheadings as letters, 
      grade levels by numbers, and specific points by numbers after the hyphen. 
      For example, benchmark IA8-2 means the second benchmark for eighth grade 
      students in the first content area, first subarea. The Asteroids project 
      meets the following benchmarks:</p>

      <p>IIIA5-2, IVA2-2, IVA5-1, IVA5-3, IVA8-4, IVF8-1, IVF8-5.</p>

      <p><b>Benchmarks</b></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#F5F5F5"><b>IIIA5-2. </b>Technology 
      enables scientists and others to observe things that are too small or too 
      far away to be seen without them and to study the motion of objects that 
      are moving very rapidly or are hardly moving at all.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#F5F5F5"><b>IVA2-2. </b>The sun 
      can be seen only in the daytime, but the moon can be seen sometimes at 
      night and sometimes during the day. The sun, moon, and stars all appear to 
      move slowly across the sky.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#F5F5F5"><b>IVA5-1. </b>The patterns 
      of stars in the sky stay the same, although they appear to move across the 
      sky nightly, and different stars can be seen in different seasons.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#F5F5F5"><b>IVA5-3. </b>Planets 
      change their positions against the background of stars.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#F5F5F5"><b>IVA8-4. </b>Large 
      numbers of chunks of rock orbit the sun. Some of those that the earth 
      meets in its yearly orbit around the sun glow and disintegrate from 
      friction as they plunge through the atmosphere-and sometimes impact the 
      ground. Other chunks of rocks mixed with ice have long, off-center orbits 
      that carry them close to the sun, where the sun's radiation (of light and 
      particles) boils off frozen material from their surfaces and pushes it 
      into a long, illuminated tail.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#F5F5F5"><b>IVF8-1. </b>Light 
      from the sun is made up of a mixture of many different colors of light, 
      even though to the eye the light looks almost white. Other things that 
      give off or reflect light have a different mix of colors</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#F5F5F5"><b>IVF8-5. </b>Human 
      eyes respond to only a narrow range of wavelengths of electromagnetic 
      radiation-visible light. Differences of wavelength within that range are 
      perceived as differences in color.</font></p>
