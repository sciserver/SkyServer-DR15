      <p><font size="4">How to Find Asteroids</font></p>
      <p>It is important to get across the point that very distant objects 
      appear to move very slowly. You may try discussing how a car passing 
      you when you are standing on the sidewalk appears to be moving faster than 
      a plane flying overhead, even though the plane is moving much faster! 
      The Moon is moving faster than the plane, yet appears to be moving even 
      slower due to its greater distance.</p>
      <p>The stars are so far away that they appear to move very little over the 
      course of a human lifespan. Even the fastest moving star, Barnard's 
      Star, takes over 200 years just to move across an length of sky equal to 
      the diameter of the full Moon!</p>
      <p>Objects close to Earth appear to move much more rapidly. For example, you can 
      have students go out and look at a satellite (see
      <a href="#fake" onclick="window.open('http://www.heavens-above.com')">Heavens Above</a> for when and 
      where to see satellites in your area). You might also describe 
      how American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto by looking at photos of the same part of the sky 
      taken on different nights and seeing an object that had moved.</p>
      <p>If an object is moving fast enough, it will actually leave a streak on 
      the film during a time exposure. The SDSS telescope takes pictures 
      through five different filters over the course of approximately six 
      minutes. A fast moving object will leave three streaks on the image: 
      one blue, one red, and one green. An extremely fast 
      moving object, such as a meteor or satellite, may leave a streak in only 
      one color (see the meteor picture on the opening page).</p>
      <p>If an object moves slowly, it not move significantly between two 
      filters. The CCD camera has five filters. If the 
      asteroid does not move significantly between the filters used for red and 
      green in the image (the i and r filters), these two colors will combine to 
      form yellow. (For more information about how the CCD camera works, see the 
      <a href="../../../../sdss/instruments/instruments.aspx#camera">About SDSS: CCD Camera</a> 
      section of SkyServer).The asteroid may have moved enough by the time it gets to the 
      blue filter that you get a blue dot next to the yellow dot. This is 
      the telltale sign of an asteroid in the SDSS data.</p>
      <p>The actual image formation is probably the most confusing part of the 
      lesson. The final SDSS image is formed by combining a red, a green and a 
      blue image. Your television works the same way. Each pixel is 
      composed of a red, a green and a blue element that can be used to produce 
      different colors. </p>
      <p>The SDSS camera does not have a red, green and blue filter, however. 
      It has a red and a green filter. In order to do make tri-color image, a 
      third filter must be used. The third filter is the infrared filter, 
      i. This leads to a rather confusing convention. The green 
      filter is used for the blue part of the image, the red filter is used for 
      the green part of the image, and the infrared filter is used for the red part of the image. 
      You can choose how in-depth you wish to discuss the camera. It 
      is only essential the students understand red and green filters can 
      combine to make yellow.</p>

      <p><font size="4">Find Those Asteroids</font></p>
      <p>This page shows three images with easily visible asteroids in them. The 
      students simply need to identify the asteroid in each image. They 
      then compare with another group to be sure they have found the asteroid. 
      If the groups disagree, they need to come to a consensus. There may 
      be more than one asteroid in some images, so students may have found a faint 
      one that is not in the solution guide!</p>
      
      <a name="hunt"></a>
      <p><font size="4">Asteroid Hunt</font></p>
      <p>Give the students a reasonable time limit to find as many asteroids as 
      they can. They can look at as many different images as they wish. 
      They will find it easier if they download the highest resolution images.
      </p>
      <p>When time is up, have the groups with the most asteroids show 
      them to the class, so the class may verify their findings. If they cannot reproduce 
      their results and find the asteroids again, they should not get credit for 
      their discovery! Emphasize that scientific results must be 
      reproducible.</p>
