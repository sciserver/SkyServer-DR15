      <p><font size="4">Classifying Galaxies</font></p>
      <p>Let the students try to classify galaxies on their own. Remind them 
      that there may be subtle differences in galaxies. Most students will recognize the 
      difference between elliptical and spiral galaxies, but not everyone will 
      make subdivisions. Ask if there are more subtle distinctions between 
      galaxies that might make a more useful classification system.</p>
      <p>When students compare their classifcation schemes, they will probably 
      find some similarities and some differences. Put a firm time limit on this 
      section so debate does not drag on.</p>
      
      <a name="types"></a>
      <p><font size="4">Spiral, Elliptical, Lenticular, and Irregular Galaxies</font></p>
      <p>These pages outline some of the distinguishing characteristics of the 
      galaxies that make up the Hubble tuning fork. Allow students to read 
      through these pages carefully so they can properly classify galaxies later 
      on. You may wish to find other pictures of galaxies for students. 
      You can find many great galaxy pictures on the Internet, from sites 
      such as the <a href="http://skyserver.pha.jhu.edu/v3/en/tools/places/">
      Famous Places</a> page of SkyServer or the 
      <a href="http://hubble.stsci.edu/">Hubble Space Telescope Archive.</a></p>
      <p>Astronomers have precise definitions for the subcategories of both 
      spiral and elliptical galaxies. However, these definitions are beyond the scope of 
      this lesson. </p>
      <p>Some lenticular galaxies are very difficult to tell from elliptical 
      galaxies. Even the best of astronomers can be fooled from time to 
      time.</p>
      <p>Make sure students realize that the terms &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; galaxies 
      have nothing whatsoever to do with the galaxies' ages. Hubble used the 
      terms because he thought that galaxies evolved from elleipticals to 
      spirals on the tuning fork. He turned out to be wrong, but the terms have 
      been kept for historical reasons.</p>
      <p>The terms are actually quite confusing 
      because elliptical galaxies have used up all their gas and have more old 
      stars than spirals. Another confusing aspect is that S0 and Sa 
      galaxies are frequently grouped with early galaxies. The terms "early" and 
      "late" galaxies do not mark a clean split between spiral and elliptical galaxies.</p>
      
      <a name="tuningfork"></a>
      <p><font size="4">The Hubble Tuning Fork</font></p>
      <p>The diagram represents how Hubble saw the galaxies. Emphasize to 
      students that he went through the same proecess that they went through 
      in Exercise 1, and the Hubble Tuning Fork was the classification system 
      he developed.</p>
      <p>A tuning fork is a device used to find the correct pitch of a 
      musical note. It looks like a fork with two prongs. Hubble put 
      elliptical galaxies on the &quot;handle&quot; of the diagram 
      and spiral and barred sprial galaxies on the two &quot;prongs&quot;. 
      Lenticular galaxies &quot;link&quot; spiral and elliptical galaxies. 
      The tuning fork is a useful visual representation of the galaxy 
      classification scheme, but has no real physical meaning.</p>
      
      <a name="clusters"></a>
      <p><font size="4">Clusters</font></p>
      <p>Astronomers have known for a long time that galaxies tend to appear in 
      large groups and clusters. Clusters of clusters form superclusters, 
      separated by great voids. One of the primary goals of the SDSS is to 
      explore the large scale structure of the universe, so galaxy clusters are 
      an important aspect of research by SDSS astronomers. You may wish to 
      have students look at some galaxy clusters in the SDSS database so they 
      get a better idea of what they look like. A list of several clusters 
      can be found on the Conclusion page of this project.</p>
      
      <a name="collisions"></a>
      <p><font size="4">Galaxy Collisions</font></p>
      <p>This section lets students see some of the spectacular galaxy 
      collisions the SDSS has captured. Remind students that even when galaxies 
      collide, the stars in them are so far apart that they rarely collide. When 
      a small galaxy collides with a large galaxy, the small galaxy is 
      frequently swallowed. This process is thought to lead to the giant 
      elliptical galaxies we see.</p>
      <a name="galcrash"></a>
      <p>You may want students to learn a little about how galaxies collide 
      using the
      <a href="#galcrash" onclick="window.open('http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/');">
      GalCrash</a> Java applet to model the collisions of galaxies. The link 
      at the bottom of the page leads to a set of supplemental exercises that 
      use GalCrash. You should try the applet out before your class does 
      the project, so you can guide them in using it.</p>
      <p>Tell students that GalCrash is a very simple program that models galaxy 
      collisions. Teach them the idea of a scientific simulation - a simple 
      model that incorporates only the most basic features of a real situation, 
      but can produce results similar to those observed in nature. Real 
      galaxies contain billions of stars. A simulation involving billions 
      of stars would not be able to run on a personal computer, so they use a 
      few thousand stars. Many fields of science include models as part of 
      their research.</p>
      
      <a name="otherways"></a>
      <p><font size="4">Other Ways to Classify Galaxies</font></p>
      <p>SDSS astronomers looked at many galaxies in the early data release and learned to 
      classify them based on color. They found that a u-r color of 
      2.22 separated early galaxies from late galaxies (you can read the entire 
      paper <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0107201">here</a>).</p>
      <p>Their method is not perfect because there is contamination from 
      other galaxy types. However, the method can be used to pefrorm statistical analysis of 
      groups and clusters of galaxies where visual classification would be 
      impractical.</p>
      <p>In this color classification scheme, S0 and Sa galaxies are considered early 
      galaxies; Sb, Sc and Irregular galaxies are considered late 
      galaxies. Students will probably find some galaxies that do not fit 
      this pattern. Students need to realize that this classification 
      scheme works well statiistically, but there are individual galaxies whose 
      types may not match their expected color.</p>
      
      <a name="conclusion"></a>
      <p><font size="4">Conclusion</font></p>
      <p>The research challenges, Exercises 5 and 6, should be completed outside 
      of class. Exercise 5 involves making color-color diagrams for galaxies. 
      Students can use these diagrams look for other patterns of galaxy distribution. Similar 
      types of galaxies should lie in similar areas on all color-color diagrams. By 
      labeling the points with galaxy type (or using Excel to color code 
      different galaxy types), students may come up with other ways of predicting 
      galaxy type based on color.</p>
      <p>Exercise 6 allows students to look at galaxy clusters. There are 
      a couple of differences they might notice. One is the evolution of 
      colors vs redshift. Galaxy clusters at different redshifts may lie 
      in slightly different regions of color space. The second difference depends on 
      the shape of the clusters. Spherical clusters (also called regular 
      clusters) tend to have an extremely high percentage of early galaxies. 
      Irregular clusters tend to have a more even mix of early and late 
      galaxies.</p>
      <p>When students finish their projects for the research challenges, have them
      <a href="mailto:raddick@pha.jhu.edu?subject=Galaxy evolution">E-mail us</a> 
      a description of their results, as well as the data they used and any 
      graphs they made. We can use .gif and .jpg images, which can be created with Adobe Photoshop, or 
      with shareware image converters like
      <a href="http://www.webattack.com/get/imageconverter.shtml" target="offsite">
      Image Converter</a>. We can also use Microsoft Excel (.xls) spreadsheet 
      files.</p>
