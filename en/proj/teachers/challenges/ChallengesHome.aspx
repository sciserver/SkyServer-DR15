<h1>SkyServer Projects - Challenges</h1>

<p>Our projects are designed to teach astronomy interactively, using the tools that 
professional astronomers use. All examples in these projects are taken from real 
stars and galaxies as seen by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the most detailed survey 
in the history of astronomy.</p>

<p>These pages give information on how to use SkyServer's projects as an interactive lab 
in your science class. The projects were designed to be done individually, but they can 
be done in teams as well. Each individual or team will need a computer with Web access. 
The table below gives an overview of each project. Click on the project's name 
for more detailed information.</p>

<p>SkyServer Challenges are designed to stretch the students' thinking with difficult 
questions and long-term projects. These challenges are even more extensive 
that the Research Challenges at the end of the other Projects.</p>

<p>Many of these challenges are ideas that SDSS astronomers thought of, 
but haven't had the chance to work through yet. So when your students finish 
a challenge, their results might be used by SDSS astronomers to advance 
their research. If you want to make a genuine, original contribution to 
the future of astronomy, this is the place to do it!</p>

<td width=55%><p>Find HII regions, the areas of glowing gas in other 
galaxies where stars are born. As you find them, you'll help the 
SDSS improve its photo processing software, which mistakes these 
regions for separate galaxies.</p></td>
