      <h1>Challenge 1 - A Catalog of HII Regions</h1>
      <h1>Correlations to Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education</h1>
      <p>The Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education is a report, 
      originally published in 1993 by the American Association for the 
      Advancement of Science (AAAS), that lists what students should know about 
      scientific literacy. The report lists facts and concepts about science 
      and the scientific process that all students should know at different 
      grade levels.</p>
      <p>The report is divided and subdivided into different content areas. 
      Within each subarea, the report lists benchmarks for students completing 
      grade 2, grade 5, grade 8, and grade 12.</p>
      <p>This page lists all the Project 2061 Benchmarks met by the Catalog of 
      HII Regions challenge. Content headings are listed as Roman numerals, subheadings 
      as letters, grade levels by numbers, and specific points by numbers after 
      the hyphen. For example, benchmark IA8-2 means the second benchmark for 
      eighth grade students in the first content area, first subarea.</p>
      
      <p>IA8-1, IB8-4, IB12-1, IC8-6, IIIA8-2, IIIA12-1, IVA8-1, IVA12-2, IVA12-3, 
      IVD8-1, IVD12-1, IVE12-4, IVE12-5, IVF8-2, IVF8-5.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Standards</b></p>

		  <p><b>IA8-1</b>. When similar investigations give different results, the 
		  scientific challenge is to judge whether the differences are trivial or 
		  significant, and it often takes further studies to decide. Even with similar 
		  results, scientists may wait until an investigation has been repeated many times 
		  before accepting the results as correct.</p>

		  <p><b>IB8-4</b>. New ideas in science sometimes spring from unexpected findings, 
		  and they usually lead to new investigations.</p>

		  <p><b>IB12-1</b>. Investigations are conducted for different reasons, including to 
		  explore new phenomena, to check on previous results, to test how well a theory 
		  predicts, and to compare different theories.</p>

          <p><b>IC8-6.</b> Computers 
          have become invaluable in science because they speed up and extend 
          people's ability to collect, store, compile, and analyze data, prepare 
          research reports, and share data and ideas with investigators all over 
          the world.</p>

          <p><b>IIIA5-2.</b> Technology enables 
          scientists and others to observe things that are too small or too far 
          away to be seen without them and to study the motion of objects that 
          are moving very rapidly or are hardly moving at all</p>

          <p><b>IIIA8-2.</b> Technology is 
          essential to science for such purposes as access to outer space and 
          other remote locations, sample collection and treatment, measurement, 
          data collection and storage, computation, and communication of 
          information.</p>

		  <p><b>IIIA12-1</b>. Technological problems often create a demand for new scientific 
		  knowledge, and new technologies make it possible for scientists to extend their 
		  research in new ways or to undertake entirely new lines of research. The very 
		  availability of new technology itself often sparks scientific advances.</p>

		  <p><b>IVA8-1</b>. The sun is a medium-sized star located near the edge of a 
		  disk-shaped galaxy of stars, part of which can be seen as a glowing band of 
		  light that spans the sky on a very clear night. The universe contains many 
		  billions of galaxies, and each galaxy contains many billions of stars. To the 
		  naked eye, even the closest of these galaxies is no more than a dim, fuzzy spot.</p>

          <p><b>IVA12-2.</b> On the basis of 
          scientific evidence, the universe is estimated to be over ten billion 
          years old. The current theory is that its entire contents expanded 
          explosively from a hot, dense, chaotic mass. Stars condensed by 
          gravity out of clouds of molecules of the lightest elements until 
          nuclear fusion of the light elements into heavier ones began to occur. 
          Fusion released great amounts of energy over millions of years. 
          Eventually, some stars exploded, producing clouds of heavy elements 
          from which other stars and planets could later condense. The process 
          of star formation and destruction continues.</p>

		  <p><b>IVA12-3</b>. Increasingly sophisticated technology is used to learn about the 
		  universe. Visual, radio, and x-ray telescopes collect information from across 
		  the entire spectrum of electromagnetic waves; computers handle an avalanche of 
		  data and increasingly complicated computations to interpret them; space probes 
		  send back data and materials from the remote parts of the solar system; and 
		  accelerators give subatomic particles energies that simulate conditions in the 
		  stars and in the early history of the universe before stars formed.</p>
		  
		  <p><b>IVD8-1</b>. All matter is made up of atoms, which are far too small to see 
		  directly through a microscope. The atoms of any element are alike but are 
		  different from atoms of other elements. Atoms may stick together in well-defined 
		  molecules or may be packed together in large arrays. Different arrangements of 
		  atoms into groups compose all substances.</p>
		  
          <p><b>IVD12-1.</b> Atoms are made of a 
          positive nucleus surrounded by negative electrons. An atom's electron 
          configuration, particularly the outermost electrons, determines how 
          the atom can interact with other atoms. Atoms form bonds to other 
          atoms by transferring or sharing electrons.</p>

          <p><b>IVE12-4.</b> Different energy 
          levels are associated with different configurations of atoms and 
          molecules. Some changes of configuration require an input of energy 
          whereas others release energy.</p>

          <p><b>IVE12-5.</b> When energy of an 
          isolated atom or molecule changes, it does so in a definite jump from 
          one value to another, with no possible values in between. The change 
          in energy occurs when radiation is absorbed or emitted, so the 
          radiation also has distinct energy values. As a result, the light 
          emitted or absorbed by separate atoms or molecules (as in a gas) can 
          be used to identify what the substance is.</p>
          
          <p><b>IVF8-2</b>. Something can be "seen" when light waves emitted or reflected 
		  by it enter the eye - just as something can be "heard" when sound waves from it 
		  enter the ear.</p>

		  <p><b>IVF8-5</b>. Human eyes respond to only a narrow range of wavelengths of 
		  electromagnetic radiation - visible light. Differences of wavelength within that 
		  range are perceived as differences in color.</p>

      <h1>Correlations to NCTM Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</h1>
      <p><i>Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</i> was released in 
      2000 by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The standards, a 
      collaboration between education researchers and school mathematics 
      teachers, lists what concepts students should understand, and what skills 
      they should possess, at different stages of their mathematics education.</p>
      <p>The report is divided and subdivided into ten different content areas. 
      Within the first six areas, the report lists benchmarks for students 
      completing grade 2, grade 5, grade 8, and grade 12. The standards met by
