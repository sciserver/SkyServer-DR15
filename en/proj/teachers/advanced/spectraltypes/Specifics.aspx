<p><b>Student Classifications of Stars</b></p>

      <p>Students should use the Get Spectra tool to find spectra for each of the 14 
      stars in the table. Many of the lines are labeled, but a few are not. If a student 
      cannot read a label because the spectrum obscures the label, they can look 
      at another star's spectrum and know that the lines are in the same order on both 
      spectra. Just a note: the four lines from the Balmer series are 
      always labeled as H<sub><font face=symbol>a</font></sub>, 
      H<sub><font face=symbol>b</font></sub>, H<sub><font face=symbol>g</font></sub>, and 
      H<sub><font face=symbol>d</font></sub>.</p>
            
      <p>Exercise 1 has no right or wrong answers. Hopefully, students 
      will put some thought into their classification systems, and will be able to 
      justify them to to others. You may have the students exchange their 
      guidelines and see if someone else can reproduce their classifcations. 
      Students will not derive the same classification scheme as astronomers because 
      they are working with such small samples. Question 3 tries to get students 
      to revise and improve their ideas, as professional scientists 
      do in their research.</p>

      <p><b>Energy Levels of Electrons</b></p>

      <p>You can choose how much you want to cover the energy levels. Many 
      chemistry classes talk about energy levels, but don't go over the 
      mathematics, even of the simple hydrogen molecule. This information may be new to 
      some students.</p>
   
      <a name="absem"></a>
      <p><b>Absorption and Emission Lines</b></p>

      <p>The wavelength values of the absorption lines in the table are 
      approximate. From these values, students should be able to see the lines on the spectra. 
      Exact numbers are not necessary, because the 
      resolution of the .gif images prevents students from reading down below 
      about the nearest 40 to 50 angstroms.</p>
            
      <p>Questions 5 and 6 should be treated as practice. They are designed 
      simply to show students the type of reasoning they will need to employ to 
      properly classify stars as they go through the lesson. Be sure students  
      realize that it is OK if they do not get the star's spectral type correct 
      the first time. Classifying spectra is not easy.</p>
      
      <p>On all the spectra, the positions of the absorption lines are marked 
      whether or not there is a line present. The table gives positions 
      of some lines in addition to the ones marked automatically on the SDSS 
      spectra. The titanium oxide lines are quite numerous, but occur in 
      distinct bunches at the listed wavelengths.</p>
      <p>Exercises 5, 6, and 7 give the students an opportunity to 
      practice classifying stars by doing an informal survey of the prevalences of 
      different spectral types. You might wish to assign each group of 
      students a different plate to work from to avoid duplication of data.
      Or, you might assign two groups to each plate to provide a check on each 
      other's data. Either way, you should have students discuss whether they feel they 
      truly did a random sample of the stars in the sky, or whether their sample 
      is somehow biased toward a certain part of the sky.</p>
      <p>Exercises 8, 9, and 10 show different types of stars that do not 
      fall into the OBAFGKM sequence. Try to foster discussion of the fact that these 
      are not the only types of stars, and there are several rare classes not 
      represented in the OBAFGKM sequence.</p>
