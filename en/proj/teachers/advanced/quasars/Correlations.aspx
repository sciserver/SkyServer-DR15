      <h1>Correlations to Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education</h1>
      <p>The Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education is a report, 
      originally published in 1993 by the American Association for the 
      Advancement of Science (AAAS), that listed what students should know about 
      scientific literacy. The report listed facts and concepts about science 
      and the scientific process that all students should know at different 
      grade levels.</p>
      <p>The report is divided and subdivided into different content areas. 
      Within each subarea, the report lists benchmarks for students completing 
      grade 2, grade 5, grade 8, and grade 12. The table below shows which 
      benchmarks are met by which sections of the Quasars project.</p>
      <p>This page lists all the Project 2061 Benchmarks met by the Quasars 
      project. Content headings are listed as Roman numerals, subheadings 
      as letters, grade levels by numbers, and specific points by numbers after 
      the hyphen. For example, benchmark IA8-2 means the second benchmark for 
      eighth grade students in the first content area, first subarea.</p>
      
      <p>The Quasars project meets the following Project 2061 Benchmarks:</p>
      <p>IA12-2, IB8-4, IB12-7., IC8-6. IIIA8-2, IVA8-2, 
      IVA12-3, IVE12-4, IVE12-5, IVF12-5.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Standards</b></p>
          <p><b>IA12-2.</b> From time to 
          time, major shifts occur in the scientific view of how the world 
          works. More often, however, the changes that take place in the body of 
          scientific knowledge are small modifications of prior knowledge. 
          Change and continuity are persistent features of science. </p>
          <p><b>IB8-4.</b> New ideas in 
          science sometimes spring from unexpected findings, and they usually 
          lead to new investigations.</p>
          <p><b>IB12-7.</b> New ideas in 
          science are limited by the context in which they are conceived; are 
          often rejected by the scientific establishment; sometimes spring from 
          unexpected findings; and usually grow slowly, through contributions 
          from many investigators.</p>
          <p><b>IC8-6.</b> Computers have 
          become invaluable in science because they speed up and extend people's 
          ability to collect, store, compile, and analyze data, prepare research 
          reports, and share data and ideas with investigators all over the 
          world.</p>
          <p><b>IIIA8-2.</b> Technology is 
          essential to science for such purposes as access to outer space and 
          other remote locations, sample collection and treatment, measurement, 
          data collection and storage, computation, and communication of 
          information</p>
          <p><b>IVA8-2.</b> The Sun is 
          many thousands of times closer to the earth than any other star. Light 
          from the sun takes a few minutes to reach the earth, but light from 
          the next nearest star takes a few years to arrive. The trip to that 
          star would take the fastest rocket thousands of years. Some distant 
          galaxies are so far away that their light takes several billion years 
          to reach the earth. People on earth, therefore, see them as they were 
          that long ago in the past.</p>
          <p><b>IVA12-3.</b> Increasingly 
          sophisticated technology is used to learn about the universe. Visual, 
          radio, and x-ray telescopes collect information from across the entire 
          spectrum of electromagnetic waves; computers handle an avalanche of 
          data and increasingly complicated computations to interpret them; 
          space probes send back data and materials from the remote parts of the 
          solar system; and accelerators give subatomic particles energies that 
          simulate conditions in the stars and in the early history of the 
          universe before stars formed.</p>
          <p><b>IVE12-4.</b> Different energy 
          levels are associated with different configurations of atoms and 
          molecules. Some changes of configuration require an input of energy 
          whereas others release energy.</p>
          <p><b>IVE12-5.</b> When energy of an 
          isolated atom or molecule changes, it does so in a definite jump from 
          one value to another, with no possible values in between. The change 
          in energy occurs when radiation is absorbed or emitted, so the 
          radiation also has distinct energy values. As a result, the light 
          emitted or absorbed by separate atoms or molecules (as in a gas) can 
          be used to identify what the substance is.</p>
          <p><b>IVF12-5.</b> The observed 
          wavelength of a wave depends upon the relative motion of the source 
          and the observer. If either is moving toward the other, the observed 
          wavelength is shorter; if either is moving away, the wavelength is 
          longer. Because the light seen from almost all distant galaxies has 
          longer wavelengths than comparable light here on earth, astronomers 
          believe that the whole universe is expanding.</p>

<h1>Correlations to NCTM Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</h1>


<p><i>Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</i> was released in 2000 by the 
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The standards, a collaboration between 
education researchers and school mathematics teachers, lists what concepts students 
should understand, and what skills they should possess, at different stages of their 
mathematics education.</p>

<p>The report is divided and subdivided into ten different content areas. Within the 
first six areas, the report lists benchmarks for students completing grade 2, grade 5, 
grade 8, and grade 12. The table below shows which standards are met by 
the Spectral Types project.</p>

<P>Content headings are listed as Roman 
numerals, subheadings as letters, grade levels as numbers, and specific 
points by numbers after the hyphen. 
For example, standard IA8-2 means the second benchmark for eighth grade 
students in the first content area, first subarea. Content areas VI through X, which 
concern skill processes in mathematics, are not divided into subareas or grade 
levels. The standards met by the Galaxies project are:</p>

<p>IA8-1, IC8-1, IC12-2, IIB12-3, IIB12-5, IIC12-3, VA8-1, VC8-2, VC8-3, VI-2, 
VI-3, <br>VIII-2, X-3.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>Standards</b></p>

<p><b>IA8-1</b>. Work flexibly with fractions, decimals, and percents to solve problems.</p>
<p><b>IC8-1</b>. Select appropriate methods and tools for computing with fractions and 
decimals from among mental computation, estimation, calculators or computers, and 
paper and pencil, depending on the situation, and apply the selected methods.</p>

<p><b>IC12-2</b>. Judge the reasonableness of numerical computations and their results.</p>

<p><b>IIB12-3</b>. Write equivalent forms of equations, inequalities, and systems of 
equations and solve them with fluency - mentally or with paper and pencil in simple 
cases and using technology in all cases.</p>

<p><b>IIB12-5</b>. Judge the meaning, utility, and reasonableness of the 
results of symbol manipulations, including those carried out by technology.</p>

<p><b>IIC12-3</b>. Draw reasonable conclusions about a situation being modeled.</p>

<p><b>VA8-1</b>. Formulate questions, design studies, and collect data about a 
characteristic shared by two populations or different characteristics within one 
population.</p>

<p><b>VC8-2</b>. Make conjectures about possible relationships between two 
characteristics of a sample on the basis of scatterplots of the data and 
approximate lines of fit.</p>

<p><b>VC8-3</b>. Use conjectures to formulate new questions and plan new studies to 
answer them.</p>

<p><b>VI-2</b>. Solve problems that arise in mathematics and other contexts.</p>

<p><b>VI-3</b>. Adapt and apply a variety of appropriate strategies to solve problems.</p>

<p><b>VIII-2</b>. Communicate their mathematical thinking coherently and clearly 
to peers, teachers, and others.</p>

<p><b>X-3</b>. Use representations to model and interpret physical, social, and 
mathematical phenomena.</p>
