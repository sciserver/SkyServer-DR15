<h1>Correlations to Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education</h1>

<p>The Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education is a report, originally published 
in 1993 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), that listed 
what students should know about scientific literacy. The report listed facts and concepts 
about science and the scientific process that all students should know at different grade
levels.</p>

<p>The report is divided and subdivided into different content areas. Within each subarea, 
the report lists benchmarks for students completing grade 2, grade 5, grade 8, and grade 12.
The table below shows which benchmarks are met by which sections of the H-R Diagram 
project.</p>

<p>The list below shows all Project 2061 benchmarks met by the H-R diagram project. 
Content headings are listed as Roman numerals, subheadings as letters, 
grade levels by numbers, and specific points by numbers after the hyphen. 
For example, benchmark IA8-2 means the second benchmark for eighth grade 
students in the first content area, first subarea.</p>

      <p>The H-R Diagram unit meets the following Project 2061 Benchmarks:</p>
      <p>IA12-1, IC8-6, IIIB8-1, IVA8-1, IVA8-2, IVA12-1, IVA12-3.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p><b>IA12-1</b>. Scientists assume 
          that the universe is a vast single system in which the basic rules are 
          the same everywhere. The rules may range from very simple to extremely 
          complex, but scientists operate on the belief that the rules can be 
          discovered by careful, systematic study.</p>
      <p><b>IC8-6</b>. Computers have 
          become invaluable in science because they speed up and extend people's 
          ability to collect, store, compile, and analyze data, prepare research 
          reports, and share data and ideas with investigators all over the 
          world.</p>
      <p><b>IIIB8-1</b>. Design usually requires taking constraints into account. 
          Some constraints, such as gravity or the properties of materials to be 
          used, are unaviodable. Other constraints, including economic, political, 
          social, ethical, and aesthetic ones, limit choices.</p>
      <p><b>IVA8-1</b>. The sun is a 
          medium-sized star located near the edge of a disk-shaped galaxy of 
          stars, part of which can be seen as a glowing band of light that spans 
          the sky on a very clear night. The universe contains many billions of 
          galaxies, and each galaxy contains many billions of stars. To the 
          naked eye, even the closest of these galaxies is no more than a dim, 
          fuzzy spot.</p>
      <p><b>IVA8-2</b>. The sun is many thousands of times closer to the earth than 
          any other star. Light from the sun takes a few minutes to reach the earth, but light 
          from the next nearest star takes a few years to arrive. The trip to that star would 
          take the fastest rocket thousands of years. Some distant galaxies are so far away 
          that their light takes several billion years to reach the earth. People on earth, 
          therefore, see them as they were that long ago in the past.</p>   
      <p><b>IVA12-1</b>. The stars differ from each other in size, temperature, and 
          age, but they appear to be made up of the same elements that are found on 
          the Earth and to behave according to the same physical principles. 
          Unlike the sun, most stars are in systems of two or more stars orbiting 
          around one another.</p>
      <p><b>IVA12-3</b>. Increasingly sophisticated technology is used to learn about the 
          universe. Visual, radio, and x-ray telescopes collect information from across the 
          entire spectrum of electromagnetic waves; computers handle an avalanche of data and 
          increasingly complicated computations to interpret them; space probes send back data 
          and materials from the remote parts of the solar system; and accelerators give 
          subatomic particles energies that simulate conditions in the stars and in the early 
          history of the universe before stars formed.</p>

<h1>Correlations to NCTM Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</h1>

<p><i>Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</i> was released in 2000 by the 
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The standards, a collaboration between 
education researchers and school mathematics teachers, lists what concepts students 
should understand, and what skills they should possess, at different stages of their 
mathematics education.</p>

<p>The report is divided and subdivided into ten different content areas. Within the 
first six areas, the report lists standards for students completing grade 2, grade 5, 
grade 8, and grade 12. The table below shows which standards are met by 
the H-R Diagram project.</p>

<P>Content headings are listed as Roman 
numerals, subheadings as letters, grade levels as numbers, and specific 
points by numbers after the hyphen. 
For example, standard IA8-2 means the second standard for eighth grade 
students in the first content area, first subarea. Content areas VI through X, which 
concern skill processes in mathematics, are not divided into subareas or grade 
levels. The standards met by the H-R Diagram project are:</p>

<p>IA8-1, IA8-4, IA8-5, IA12-1, IB12-1, IC8-1, IC12-2, IIA12-5, IIC8-1, IIC12-3, IVA8-2, 
IVA12-1, IVB12-4, VA8-2, VB8-2, VC8-2, VC8-3, VI-2, VIII-2, IX-3, X-3.</P>
