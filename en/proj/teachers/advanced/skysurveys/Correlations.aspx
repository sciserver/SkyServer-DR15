      <h1>Correlations to Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education</h1>
      <p>The Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education is a report, 
      originally published in 1993 by the American Association for the 
      Advancement of Science (AAAS), that listed what students should know about 
      scientific literacy. The report listed facts and concepts about science 
      and the scientific process that all students should know at different 
      grade levels.</p>
      <p>The report is divided and subdivided into different content areas. 
      Within each subarea, the report lists benchmarks for students completing 
      grade 2, grade 5, grade 8, and grade 12.</p>
      <p>The Sky Surveys project meets the following objectives in the Project 2061 
      Benchmarks:</p>
      <p>IC8-6, IIIA5-2, IIIA8-2, IVA12-3, IVF8-1, IVF12-3.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Benchmarks</b></p>
      <p><b>IC8-6.</b> Computers have 
          become invaluable in science because they speed up and extend people's 
          ability to collect, store, compile, and analyze data, prepare research 
          reports, and share data and ideas with investigators all over the 
          world.</p>
      <p><b>IIIA5-2.</b> Technology enables 
          scientists and others to observe things that are too small or too far 
          away to be seen without them and to study the motion of objects that 
          are moving very rapidly or are hardly moving at all.</p>
      <p><b>IIIA8-2.</b> Technology is 
          essential to science for such purposes as access to outer space and 
          other remote locations, sample collection and treatment, measurement, 
          data collection and storage, computation, and communication of 
          information.</p>
      <p><b>IVA12-3.</b> Increasingly 
          sophisticated technology is used to learn about the universe. Visual, 
          radio, and x-ray telescopes collect information from across the entire 
          spectrum of electromagnetic waves; computers handle an avalanche of 
          data and increasingly complicated computations to interpret them; 
          space probes send back data and materials from the remote parts of the 
          solar system; and accelerators give subatomic particles energies that 
          simulate conditions in the stars and in the early history of the 
          universe before stars formed.</p>
      <p><b>IVF8-1.</b> Human eyes 
          respond to only a narrow range of wavelengths of electromagnetic 
          radiation—visible light. Differences of wavelength within that range 
          are perceived as differences in color.</p>
      <p><b>IVF12-3.</b> Accelerating 
          electric charges produce electromagnetic waves around them. A great 
          variety of radiations are electromagnetic waves: radio waves, 
          microwaves, radiant heat, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, x 
          rays, and gamma rays. These wavelengths vary from radio waves, the 
          longest, to gamma rays, the shortest. In empty space, all 
          electromagnetic waves move at the same speed—the &quot;speed of light.&quot;</p>
