      <h1>Correlations to Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education</h1>
      
      <p>The Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education is a report, originally published 
in 1993 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), that lists 
what students should know about scientific literacy. The report lists facts and concepts 
about science and the scientific process that all students should know at different grade
levels.</p>

<p>The report is divided and subdivided into different content areas. Within each subarea, 
the report lists benchmarks for students completing grade 2, grade 5, grade 8, and grade 12.</p>

<p>This page lists all the Project 2061 Benchmarks met by the Galaxies project. 
Content headings are listed as Roman 
numerals, subheadings as letters, grade levels by numbers, and specific points by numbers 
after the hyphen. For example, benchmark IA8-2 means the second benchmark for eighth grade 
students in the first content area, first subarea.</p> 

      <p>The Galaxies unit meets the following Project 2061 Benchmarks:</p>
            
      <p>IA12-2, IVA8-1, IVA8-2, IVE12-4, IVE12-5.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Standards</b></p>
          
      <p><b>IA12-2.</b> From time to time, 
          major shifts occur in the scientific view of how the world works. More 
          often, however, the changes that take place in the body of scientific 
          knowledge are small modifications of prior knowledge. Change and 
          continuity are persistent features of science. </p>

<p><b>IVA8-1</b>. The sun is a medium-sized star located near the edge of a 
disk-shaped galaxy of stars, part of which can be seen as a glowing band of light 
that spans the sky on a very clear night. The universe contains many billions of 
galaxies, and each galaxy contains many billions of stars. To the naked eye, even 
the closest of these galaxies is no more than a dim, fuzzy spot.</p>


       <p><b>IVA8-2.</b> The sun is many 
          thousands of times closer to the earth than any other star. Light from 
          the sun takes a few minutes to reach the earth, but light from the 
          next nearest star takes a few years to arrive. The trip to that star 
          would take the fastest rocket thousands of years. Some distant 
          galaxies are so far away that their light takes several billion years 
          to reach the earth. People on earth, therefore, see them as they were 
          that long ago in the past.</p>

       <p><b>IVE12-4.</b> Different energy 
          levels are associated with different configurations of atoms and 
          molecules. Some changes of configuration require an input of energy 
          whereas others release energy.</p>

       <p><b>IVE12-5.</b> When energy 
          of an isolated atom or molecule changes, it does so in a definite jump 
          from one value to another, with no possible values in between. The 
          change in energy occurs when radiation is absorbed or emitted, so the 
          radiation also has distinct energy values. As a result, the light 
          emitted or absorbed by separate atoms or molecules (as in a gas) can 
          be used to identify what the substance is.</p>

<h1>Correlations to NCTM Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</h1>

<p><i>Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</i> was released in 2000 by the 
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The standards, a collaboration between 
education researchers and school mathematics teachers, lists what concepts students 
should understand, and what skills they should possess, at different stages of their 
mathematics education.</p>

<p>The report is divided and subdivided into ten different content areas. Within the 
first six areas, the report lists benchmarks for students completing grade 2, grade 5, 
grade 8, and grade 12.</p>

<P>Content headings are listed as Roman 
numerals, subheadings as letters, grade levels as numbers, and specific 
points by numbers after the hyphen. 
For example, standard IA8-2 means the second standard for eighth grade 
students in the first content area, first subarea. Content areas VI through X, which 
concern skill processes in mathematics, are not divided into subareas or grade 
levels. The standards met by the Galaxies project are:</p>

<p>IA8-1, IC8-1, IC12-2, IIB12-3, IIB12-5, IIC12-3, VA8-1, VC8-2, VC8-3, VI-2, 
VI-3, <br>VIII-2, X-3.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>Standards</b></p>

<p><b>IA8-1</b>. Work flexibly with fractions, decimals, and percents to solve problems.</p>
<p><b>IC8-1</b>. Select appropriate methods and tools for computing with fractions and 
decimals from among mental computation, estimation, calculators or computers, and 
paper and pencil, depending on the situation, and apply the selected methods.</p>

<p><b>IC12-2</b>. Judge the reasonableness of numerical computations and their results.</p>

<p><b>IIB12-3</b>. Write equivalent forms of equations, inequalities, and systems of 
equations and solve them with fluency - mentally or with paper and pencil in simple 
cases and using technology in all cases.</p>

<p><b>IIB12-5</b>. Judge the meaning, utility, and reasonableness of the 
results of symbol manipulations, including those carried out by technology.</p>

<p><b>IIC12-3</b>. Draw reasonable conclusions about a situation being modeled.</p>

<p><b>VA8-1</b>. Formulate questions, design studies, and collect data about a 
characteristic shared by two populations or different characteristics within one 
population.</p>

<p><b>VC8-2</b>. Make conjectures about possible relationships between two 
characteristics of a sample on the basis of scatterplots of the data and 
approximate lines of fit.</p>

<p><b>VC8-3</b>. Use conjectures to formulate new questions and plan new studies to 
answer them.</p>

<p><b>VI-2</b>. Solve problems that arise in mathematics and other contexts.</p>

<p><b>VI-3</b>. Adapt and apply a variety of appropriate strategies to solve problems.</p>

<p><b>VIII-2</b>. Communicate their mathematical thinking coherently and clearly 
to peers, teachers, and others.</p>

<p><b>X-3</b>. Use representations to model and interpret physical, social, and 
mathematical phenomena.</p>
