<h1>Correlations to Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education</h1>

<p>The Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education is a report, originally published 
in 1993 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), that listed 
what students should know about scientific literacy. The report listed facts and concepts 
about science and the scientific process that all students should know at different grade
levels.</p>

<p>The report is divided and subdivided into different content areas. Within each subarea, 
the report lists benchmarks for students completing grade 2, grade 5, grade 8, and grade 12.
The table below shows which benchmarks are met by which sections of the Hubble Diagram 
project.</p>

<p>The left column lists the sections of the project. The right column lists all benchmarks 
that are at least partially discussed by that section. Content headings are listed as Roman 
numerals, subheadings as letters, grade levels by numbers, and specific points by numbers 
after the hyphen. For example, benchmark IA8-2 means the second benchmark for eighth grade 
students in the first content area, first subarea. All benchmarks met by the Colors 
project are listed below the table.</p>

<p><b>Standards</b></p>
<p></p>

<p><b>IA8-1</b>. When similar investigations give different results, the scientific 
challenge is to judge whether the differences are trivial or significant, and it often 
takes further studies to decide. Even with similar results, scientists may wait until an 
investigation has been repeated many times before accepting the results as correct.</p>

<p><b>IA12-1</b>. Scientists assume that the universe is a vast single system in which the 
basic rules are the same everywhere. The rules may range from the very simple to the 
extremely complex, but scientists operate on the belief that the rules can be 
discovered by careful, systematic study.</p>

<p><b>IB8-2</b>. If more than one variable changes at the same time in an experiment, 
the outcome of the experiment may not be clearly attributable to any one of the 
variables. It may not always be possible to prevent outside variables from influencing 
the outcome of an investigation (or even to identify all of the variables), but 
collaboration among investigators can often lead to research designs that are able 
to deal with such situations.</p>

<p><b>IB12-1</b>. Investigations are conducted for different reasons, including 
to explore new phenomena, to check on previous results, to test how well a theory 
predicts, and to compare different theories.</p>

<p><b>IB12-2</b>. Hypotheses are widely used in science for choosing what data 
to pay attention to and what additional data to seek, and for guiding the 
interpretation of the data (both new and previously available).</p>

<p><b>IB12-3</b>. Sometimes, scientists can control conditions in order to obtain evidence. 
When that is not possible for practical or ethical reasons, they try to observe as 
wide a range of natural occurrences as possible to be able to discern patterns.</p>

<p><b>IB12-4</b>. There are different traditions in science about what is investigated 
and how, but they all have in common certain basic beliefs about the value of evidence, 
logic, and good arguments. And there is agreement that progress in all fields of 
science depends on intelligence, hard work, imagination, and even chance.</p>

<p><b>IC8-6</b>. Computers have become invaluable in science because they speed 
up and extend people's ability to collect, store, compile, and analyze data, 
prepare research reports, and share data and ideas with investigators all over the 
world.</p>

<p><b>IC8-7</b>. Accurate record-keeping, openness, and replication are essential 
for maintaining an investigator's credibility with other scientists and society.</p>

<p><b>IIIA8-2</b>. Technology is essential to science for such purposes as access 
to outer space and other remote locations, sample collection and treatments, 
measurement, data collection and storage, computation, and communication of 
information.</p>

<p><b>IVA8-1</b>. The sun is a medium-sized star located near the edge of a 
disk-shaped galaxy of stars, part of which can be seen as a glowing band of light 
that spans the sky on a very clear night. The universe contains many billions of 
galaxies, and each galaxy contains many billions of stars. To the naked eye, even 
the closest of these galaxies is no more than a dim, fuzzy spot.</p>

<p><b>IVA8-2</b>. The sun is many thousands of times closer to the earth than 
any other star. Light from the sun takes a few minutes to reach the earth, but light 
from the next nearest star takes a few years to arrive. The trip to that star would 
take the fastest rocket thousands of years. Some distant galaxies are so far away 
that their light takes several billion years to reach the earth. People on earth, 
therefore, see them as they were that long ago in the past.</p>

<p><b>IVA12-1</b>. The stars differ from each other in size, temperature, 
and age, but they appear to be made up of the same elements that are found on the 
earth and to behave according to the same physical principles. Unlike the sun, most 
stars are in systems of two or more stars orbiting around one another.</p>

<p><b>IVA12-2</b>. On the basis of scientific evidence, the universe is 
estimated to be over ten billion years old. The current theory is that its 
entire contents expanded explosively from a hot, dense, chaotic mass. Stars 
condensed by gravity out of clouds of molecules of the lightest elements until 
nuclear fusion of the light elements into heavier ones began to occur. Fusion released 
great amounts of energy over millions of years. Eventually, some stars exploded, 
producing clouds of heavy elements from which other stars and planets could later 
condense. The process of star formation and destruction continues.</p>

<p><b>IVA12-3</b>. Increasingly sophisticated technology is used to learn about the 
universe. Visual, radio, and x-ray telescopes collect information from across the 
entire spectrum of electromagnetic waves; computers handle an avalanche of data and 
increasingly complicated computations to interpret them; space probes send back data 
and materials from the remote parts of the solar system; and accelerators give 
subatomic particles energies that simulate conditions in the stars and in the early 
history of the universe before stars formed.</p>

<p><b>IVD8-1</b>. All matter is made up of atoms, which are far too small to see directly 
through a microscope. The atoms of any element are alike but are different from atoms 
of other elements. Atoms may stick together in well-defined molecules or may be packed 
together in large arrays. Different arrangements of atoms into groups compose all 
substances.</p>

<p><b>IVD8-3</b>. Atoms and molecules are perpetually in motion. Increased temperature 
means greater average energy, so most substances expand when heated. In solids, 
the atoms are closely locked in position and can only vibrate. In liquids, the atoms 
or molecules have higher energy, are more loosely connected, and can slide past one 
another; some molecules may get enough energy to escape into a gas. In gases, the 
atoms or molecules have still more energy and are free of one another except during 
occasional collisions.</p>

<p><b>IVD8-5</b>. Scientific ideas about elements were borrowed from some Greek 
philosophers of 2,000 years earlier, who believed that everything was made from 
four basic substances: air, earth, fire, and water. It was the combinations of 
these "elements" in different proportions that gave other substances their observable 
properties. The Greeks were wrong about those four, but now over 100 different elements 
have been identifies, some rare and some plentiful, out of which everything is 
made. Because most elements tend to combine with others, few elements are found 
in their pure form.</p>

<p><b>IVE12-2</b>. Heat energy in a material consists of the disordered motions 
of its atoms or molecules. In any interactions of atoms or molecules, the statistical 
odds are that they will end up with less order than they began - that is, with the heat 
energy spread out more evenly. With huge numbers of atoms and molecules, the greater 
disorder is almost certain.</p>

<p><b>IVF8-1</b>. Light from the sun is made up of a mixture of many different colors 
of light, even though to the eye the light looks almost white> Other things that give 
off or reflect light have a different mix of colors.</p>

<p><b>IVF8-2</b>. Something can be "seen" when light waves emitted or reflected 
by it enter the eye - just as something can be "heard" when sound waves from it 
enter the ear.</p>

<p><b>IVF8-5</b>. Human eyes respond to only a narrow range of wavelengths of 
electromagnetic radiation - visible light. Differences of wavelength within that 
range are perceived as differences in color.</p>

<p><b>IVF12-3</b>. Accelerating electric charges produce electromagnetic waves around 
them. A great variety of radiations are electromagnetic waves: radio waves, microwaves, 
radiant heat, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, x rays, and gamma rays. These 
wavelengths vary from radio waves, the longest, to gamma rays, the shortest. In empty 
space, all electromagnetic waves move at the same speed - the "speed of light."</p>

<h1>Correlations to NCTM Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</h1>

<p><i>Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</i> was released in 2000 by the 
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The standards, a collaboration between 
education researchers and school mathematics teachers, lists what concepts students 
should understand, and what skills they should possess, at different stages of their 
mathematics education.</p>

<p>The report is divided and subdivided into ten different content areas. Within the 
first six areas, the report lists benchmarks for students completing grade 2, grade 5, 
grade 8, and grade 12. The table below shows which standards are met by which 
sections of the Colors in Astronomy project.</p>

<p>The left column lists the sections of the project. The right column lists all standards  
that are at least partially discussed by that section. Content headings are listed as Roman 
numerals, subheadings as letters, grade levels as numbers, and specific 
points by numbers after the hyphen. 
For example, standard IA8-2 means the second benchmark for eighth grade 
students in the first content area, first subarea. Content areas VI through X, which 
concern skill processes in mathematics, are not divided into subareas or grade 
levels. All standards met by the Hubble diagram project are listed below the table.</p>
