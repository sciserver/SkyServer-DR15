      <h1>Correlations to Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education</h1>
      <p>The Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education is a report, 
      originally published in 1993 by the American Association for the 
      Advancement of Science (AAAS), that listed what students should know about 
      scientific literacy. The report listed facts and concepts about science 
      and the scientific process that all students should know at different 
      grade levels.</p>
      <p>The report is divided and subdivided into different content areas. 
      Within each subarea, the report lists benchmarks for students completing 
      grade 2, grade 5, grade 8, and grade 12. The table below shows which 
      benchmarks are met by which sections of the Image Processing project.</p>
      <p>The Image Processing unit meets the following objectives in the Project 
      2061 Science Standards:</p>
      <p>IC8-6, IIIA5-2, IVA5-2, IVA12-3, IVF8-1, IVF8-5.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Standards</b></p>
      <p><b>IC8-6.</b> Computers have 
          become invaluable in science because they speed up and extend people's 
          ability to collect, store, compile, and analyze data, prepare research 
          reports, and share data and ideas with investigators all over the 
          world.</p>
      <p><b>IIIA5-2.</b> Technology 
          enables scientists and others to observe things that are too small or 
          too far away to be seen without them and to study the motion of 
          objects that are moving very rapidly or are hardly moving at all</p>
      <p><b>IVA5-2.</b> Telescopes 
          magnify the appearance of some distant objects in the sky, including 
          the moon and the planets. The number of stars that can be seen through 
          telescopes is dramatically greater than can be seen by the unaided 
          eye.</p>
      <p><b>IVA12-3</b>. Increasingly 
          sophisticated technology is used to learn about the universe. Visual, 
          radio, and x-ray telescopes collect information from across the entire 
          spectrum of electromagnetic waves; computers handle an avalanche of 
          data and increasingly complicated computations to interpret them; 
          space probes send back data and materials from the remote parts of the 
          solar system; and accelerators give subatomic particles energies that 
          simulate conditions in the stars and in the early history of the 
          universe before stars formed.</p>
     <p><b>IVF8-1.</b> Light from 
          the sun is made up of a mixture of many different colors of light, 
          even though to the eye the light looks almost white. Other things that 
          give off or reflect light have a different mix of colors</p>
     <p><b>IVF8-5.</b> Human eyes 
          respond to only a narrow range of wavelengths of electromagnetic 
          radiation—visible light. Differences of wavelength within that range 
          are perceived as differences in color.</p>
