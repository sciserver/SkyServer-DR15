      <h1>SDSS Scavenger Hunt</h1>
      <h1>Teacher Notes</h1>
      <p>The Scavenger Hunt is a good way for your students to get some practice using the 
      Navigation tool. It also helps them get used to looking at 
      astronomical images and picking out important details. 
      Students will also become familiar with some of the most prominent objects 
      that are observed by the SDSS. The scavenger hunt also serves as a basic 
      introduction to filters and to the magnitude system astronomers use to 
      measure brightness.</p>
      <p>You may wish to set a time limit for students to find all the objects. 
      It is all right if students don't find all of them; some are quite 
      difficult to find. Question 20 can act as a tiebreaker. It is unlikely 
      that two students will find an object with exactly the same large i-z value.
      </p>
      <p>Make sure the students record ra and dec of all their 
      finds. You may wish to have students exchange papers at the end to 
      verify each student found all the objects they claim. Any 
      disputes can be submitted to the class as a whole. Exchanging results 
      to verify claims will introduce students to the concept of peer review.</p>

      <h1>Background Knowledge</h1>
      <p>Students should be familiar with what stars, galaxies and asteroids are. 
      They do not need in-depth knowledge, but a basic understanding of the 
      vocabulary should be enough. They also should know what color filters are 
      and have a basic idea of why people might use them.
      </p>
      
      <a name="colors"></a>
      <h1>Colors</h1>
      <p></p>
      <p>If your school has a theater, you can probably get some gels (colored 
      filters that cover lights) to demonstrate what filters are. Show students that 
      some colors appear brighter through some filters than others (for instance, look 
      at a piece of red construction paper through a red filter and a blue filter and have 
      them notice the difference). </p>
      <p>Students do not need to understand the magnitude system in its entirety, 
      but they should understand that lower numbers mean that the object is brighter.</p>
      
      <a name="objecttypes"></a>
      <h1>Object Types</h1>
      <p>You may wish to spend a few minutes talking about the different types 
      of objects students will be searching for. Extra examples of most of 
      these objects can be found in SkyServer's 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://skyserver.sdss.org/en/tools/places/">
      Famous Places.</a> Galaxy clusters and star clusters can be 
      difficult to tell apart sometimes. Use the Navigation tool to check 
      which types of objects students have found in their clusters.</p>
      
      <a name="correlations"></a>
      <H1>Correlation to Project 2061 Standards for Science Education</H1>
<P>The <A href="#corr" 
onclick="window.open('http://www.project2061.org');">Project 2061 Benchmarks in 
Science Education</A> is a report, originally published in 1993 by the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), that listed what students 
should know about scientific literacy. The report listed facts and concepts 
about science and the scientific process that all students should know at 
different grade levels.</P>
<P>The report is divided and subdivided into different content areas and subareas. Within 
each subarea, the report lists benchmarks for students completing grade 2, grade 
5, grade 8, and grade 12. In these notes, benchmark content headings are listed 
as Roman numerals, subheadings as letters, grade levels by numbers, and specific 
points by numbers after the hyphen. For example, benchmark IA2-1 means the first 
benchmark for second grade students in the first content area, first 
subarea.</P>
<P>The SDSS Scavenger Hunt project meets the following Project 2061 
benchmarks:</P>
<P>IB2-3, IC2-1, IC2-2, IIIA2-1, IIIA5-2, IIIA5-3, IVA2-1, IVA5-2, IVA5-5.</P> 

<p><b>Standards</b></p>
<p><b>IB2-3.</b> Describing things as accurately as possible is important in science 
because it enables people to compare their observations with those of others.</p>

<p><b>IC2-1.</b> Everybody can do science and invent things and ideas.</p>

<p><b>IC2-2.</b> Clear communication is an essential part of doing science. It 
enables scientists to inform others about their work, expose their ideas to criticism 
by other scientists, and stay informed about scientific discoveries around the world.</p>

<p><b>IIIA2-1.</b> Tools are used to do things better or more easily and to do some things that could 
not otherwise be done at all. In technology, tools are used to observe, measure, 
and make things.</p>

<p><b>IIIA5-2.</b> Technology enables scientists and others to observe things that are 
too small or too far away to be seen without them and to study the motion of objects 
that are moving very rapidly or are hardly moving at all.</p>

<p><b>IIIA5-3.</b> Measuring instruments can be used to gather accurate information for 
making scientific comparisons of objects and events and for designing and constructing 
things that will work properly.</p>

<p><b>IVA2-1.</b> There are more stars in the sky than anyone can easily count, but 
they are not scattered evenly, and they are not all the same in brightness or color.</p>

<p><b>IVA5-2.</b> Telescopes magnify the appearance of some distant objects in the sky, 
including the moon and the planets. The number of stars that can be seen through 
telescopes is dramatically greater than can be seen by the unaided eye.</p>

<p><b>IVA5-5.</b> Stars are like the sun, some being smaller and some larger, but 
so far away that they look like points of light.</p>
