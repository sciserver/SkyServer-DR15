      <h2>NSES (Science)</h2>

      <p>K-4 - Inquiry - Abilities - 3. Employ simple equipment and tools to gather data and extend the senses<br>
       K-4 - Inquiry - Abilities - 5. Communicate investigations and explanations<br>
       K-4 - History of Science - Human Endeavor - 1. Science and technology have been practiced for a long time<br>
       5-8 - Inquiry - Abilities - 6. Recognize and analyze alternative explanations and predictions<br>
       5-8 - History of Science - History - 2. In historical perspective, science has been practiced by different individuals in different cultures. In looking at the history of many peoples, one finds that scientists and engineers of high achievement are considered to be among the most valued contributors to their culture.</p>

      <h2>AAAS Project 2061 Benchmarks (Science)</h2>

      <p>Nature of Science - World View - 6-8 - 3. Some scientific knowledge is very old and yet is still applicable today.<br>
      Nature of Science - Inquiry - 6-8 - 3. What people expect to observe often affects what they actually do observe. Strong beliefs about what should happen in particular circumstances can prevent them from detecting other results. Scientists know about this danger to objectivity and take steps to try and avoid it when designing investigations and examining data. One safeguard is to have different investigators conduct independent studies of the same questions.<br>
      Nature of Science - Enterprise - 3-5 - 1. Science is an adventure that people everywhere can take part in, as they have for many centuries.<br>
      Nature of Science - Enterprise - 6-8 - 1. Important contributions to the advancement of science, mathematics, and technology have been made by different kinds of people, in different cultures, at different times.<br>
      Nature of Science - Enterprise - 6-8 - 6. Computers have become invaluable in science because they speed up and extend people's ability to collect, store, compile, and analyze data, prepare research reports, and share data and ideas with investigators all over the world.<br>
      The Physical Setting - Universe - K-2 - 1. There are more stars in the sky than anyone can easily count, but they are not scattered evenly, and they are not all the same in brightness or color.<br>
      The Physical Setting - Universe - 3-5 - 1. The patterns of stars in the sky stay the same, although they appear to move across the sky nightly, and different stars can be seen in different seasons.</p>

      3-5 - 5. Use technology tools (e.g., multimedia authoring, presentation, Web tools, digital cameras, scanners) for individual and collaborative writing, communication, and publishing activities to create knowledge products for audiences inside and outside the classroom.<br>
      3-5 - 8. Use technology resources (e.g., calculators, data collection probes, videos, educational software) for problem solving, self-directed learning, and extended learning activities.</p>
