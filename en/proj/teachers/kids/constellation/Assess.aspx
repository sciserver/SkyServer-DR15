      <h2>Assessment Ideas</h2>

      <p>This project is a designed to be a fun activity, so it shouldn't be graded too stringently. Students should receive some points for participation. The rest of their grades should be based on their constellations: the quality of their outlines and whether they are able to find the constellations on SkyServer.</p>

      <a name="rubric"></a>
      <h2>Scoring Rubric</h2>

      <p>The project scoring rubric (link below) will help you grade student work for this project. The rubric is divided into five categories, including participation. Each category is graded from 0 to 4, forming a table. Each entry in the table describes what student work of that quality should look like. One category of work is the constellation story, described in the "Follow-Up" section of the lesson plan. Total the number of points for each category to find the student's total score.</p>

      <p>Feel free to modify the rubric for use with your students.</p>
