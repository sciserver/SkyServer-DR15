      <p>This project introduces students to constellations, shapes people have seen in the stars. The constellations are like a game of "connect the dots" - ancient people looked at stars in the sky and connected them to form the shapes of things they were familiar with, like lions or bears. The constellations are not real groupings of stars, but they provide a rich source of stories and myths that we still use today. This lesson teaches students what constellations are, and lets them make their own constellations from SkyServer data.</p>
