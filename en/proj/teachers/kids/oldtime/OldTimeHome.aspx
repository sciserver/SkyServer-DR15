      <h1>Old Time Astronomy</h1>
      <h1>Teacher Notes</h1>
      <p>This unit tries to get students thinking about how to record their 
      ideas. Each student will have different artistic skills and 
      different perceptions of the images we present. You should emphasize
      that there is no such thing as the best sketch. Even a 
      relatively crude sketch can convey useful information, while the most 
      artistically pleasing sketch can be misleading about the nature of the object.</p>
      <p>You may wish to show more examples of sketches of 
      astronomical objects. Numerous books have been published about
      astronomers such as Charles Messier, William Herschel and Percival Lowell, 
      who were noted for their ability to sketch astronomical 
      objects.</p>
      <p>When you assign students an object to sketch, make sure you assign each 
      object to at least two students. It is all right if three students 
      all have the same object as well if you are more comfortable with larger 
      groups or have a larger class If you need more objects for students to sketch, 
      you may search the SkyServer database. All the 
      objects in this exercise were taken from the &quot;Famous Places&quot; section of 
      SkyServer.</p>
      <p>Emphasize that it is OK for sketches to look different, sometimes 
      drastically different. The lack of a good data collection method 
      slowed progress in astronomy for hundreds of years. </p>
      <p>If you click on the link to the sketches done by an amateur 
      astronomer on the first page, you will see a black background. He 
      used white paper and regular graphite pencils to make the sketches. When he scanned 
      them into the computer, he inverted the colors to give a black background 
      and white objects. If you have access to a scanner, you may try the 
      same procedure with your students. Exact instructions should be in 
      your image processing software documentation, but it is usually as easy as 
      clicking on something that says &quot;Invert Image&quot;.</p>

      <h1>Background Knowledge</h1>
      
      <p>No real background knowledge is necessary for students to successfully 
      complete this project. Some students may recognize what they are 
      drawing are galaxies, but there is no need for them to even know this 
      fact. It was not until early in the 20th Century that anyone 
      realized galaxies outside our own existed.</p>

      <h1>Project Structure</h1>
      
      <p>The goal of this project is to get students to make careful 
      observations and record them the best they can. Other than the 
      importance of making good observations, discussion before you begin 
      probably should be minimal. Let the students discover the pitfalls 
      themselves as they progress through the project.</p>

      <h1>Correlation to Project 2061 Standards for Science Education</h1>
      
      <p>The <a href="#corr" onclick="window.open('http://www.project2061.org');">
      Project 2061 Benchmarks in Science Education</a> is a report, originally published 
in 1993 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), that listed 
what students should know about scientific literacy. The report listed facts and concepts 
about science and the scientific process that all students should know at different grade
levels.</p>

<p>The report is divided and subdivided into different content areas. Within each subarea, 
the report lists benchmarks for students completing grade 2, grade 5, grade 8, and grade 12.
In these notes, benchmark content headings are listed as Roman numerals, subheadings 
as letters, grade levels by numbers, and specific points by numbers after the hyphen. 
For example, benchmark IA2-1 means the first benchmark for second grade 
students in the first content area, first subarea.</p>

      
      <p>The Old Time Astronomy project meets the following Project 2061 benchmarks:</p>
      <p>IA2-1, IB5-1, IA8-1, IB2-1, IB2-3, IB5-2, IC2-2.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Standards</b></p>
          <p><b>IA2-1</b>. When a science investigation is done the way it was done before, we 
          expect to get a very similar result.</p>
          <p><b>IB5-1</b>. Results of similar 
          scientific investigations seldom turn out exactly the same. Sometimes 
          this is because of unexpected differences in the things being 
          investigated, sometimes because of unrealized differences in the 
          methods used or in the circumstances in which the investigation is 
          carried out, and sometimes just because of uncertainties in 
          observations. It is not always easy to tell which.</p>
          <p><b>IA8-1</b>. When 
          similar investigations give different results, the scientific 
          challenge is to judge whether the differences are trivial or 
          significant, and it often takes further studies to decide. 
          Even with similar results, scientists may wait until an 
          investigation has been repeated many times before 
          accepting the results as correct.</p>
          <p><b>IB2-1</b>. People 
          can often learn about things around them by just observing those 
          things carefully, but sometimes they can learn more by doing something 
          to the things and noting what happens.</p>
          <p><b>IB2-3</b>. Describing things as 
          accurately as possible is important in science because it enables 
          people to compare their observations with those of others.</p>
          <p><b>IB5-2</b>. Results of scientific investigations are seldom exactly 
          the same, but if the differences are large, it is important to try to 
          figure out why. One reason for following directions carefully and for 
          keeping records of one's work is to provide information on what might 
          have caused the differences.</p>
          <p><b>IC2-2</b>. In 
          doing science, it is often helpful to work with a team and to share 
          findings with others. All team members should reach their own 
          individual conclusions, however, about what the findings mean.</p>
