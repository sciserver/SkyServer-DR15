      <p>NOTE: This is a step-by-step tutorial for those new to SQL. If you already know some 
      SQL and want a more in-depth introduction to how SQL applies to SkyServer, see 
      <a href="../../docs/sql_help.aspx">Using SQL with SkyServer</a>.</p>

      <p>Another great way to learn SQL is to modify and submit queries that other people have already 
      written. To jump right in to modifying queries written by scientists, see the 
      <a href="../../docs/realquery.aspx">Sample SQL Queries.</a></p>

      <h1>Searching for Data: A Tutorial</h1>
      <p>Did you know that you can search through SkyServer's database 
      for only the objects you are interested in? For example, you might want 
      to find all the bright blue galaxies for which we have obtained spectra. 
      Looking through all the hundreds of millions of SDSS objects with the Navigation tool 
      could take years. But using 
      <a href="" onclick="window.open('rightsearch.html','sidebar','width=350,height=600,resizeable,scrollbars');">
      the right search</a>, 
      you could find 10 bright blue galaxies with spectra in seconds!</p>      
      <p>If you know how to retrieve 
      the right data, you can ask millions of different questions. Searching 
      SkyServer is an incredibly powerful tool for conducting astronomy research; 
      in fact, many professional astronomers search the data in the same way you 
      can.</p>
      <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to search SkyServer to answer 
      many useful astronomical questions. Do the tutorial at your own pace, 
      and use the links to the right to return to points later in the tutorial. As you 
      work, you may also want to look at the <a href="../../docs/realquery.aspx">Sample 
      Queries</a>, which are examples of real queries that other people have written to 
      search the database.</p>
