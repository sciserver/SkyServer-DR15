<font color=white>&nbsp;To find the number of objects in the field too close 
to the edge of their fields, use the "EDGE" flag in the following 
query:</font></p>

<p><font color=white>
<pre>
    select 
        count(objID)
    from 
        photoObj
    where 
        run=5112 
        and camcol=6 
        and field=119
        and (flags & dbo.fPhotoFlags('EDGE')) > 0
</pre>
</p>

<p>The query returns a count of 17.</p>

<p>To find the total number of objects in the field, use the same query without 
the flag:</p>

<p><font color=white>
<pre>
    SELECT 
        count(objID)
    FROM
        photoObj
    WHERE
        run=5112
        and camcol=6 
        and field=119
</pre>

<p>This query returns a count of 670.</p>

<p>So the percentage of objects too close to the field edge to trust is 
17 / 670, or about 3%.</p>

<font color=white>First, select a galaxy cluster from the Famous Places 
tool and look at it in the Navigation Tool. As an example, these answers 
will use Abell 0957.</font></p>

<p>Galaxy clusters tend to have similar colors, or differences in 
magnitudes. Color is one of the most reliable ways to identify which 
galaxies are in a cluster. Most of the galaxies in Abell 0957 have a 
g-r color of about 0.8. So a search should consider galaxies with g-r 
of about 0.6 to 1.</p>

<p>The galaxies in Abell 0958 appear to extend about 0.15 degrees, or 
9 arcminutes. The brightest galaxy in Abell 0958 appears to have an r 
magnitude of about 13. The faintest galaxy appears to be at about r = 18.</p>

<p>Combining all these results into one query:</p>

<p><font color=white>
<pre>
    SELECT 
        p.objID, p.ra, p.dec, p.u, p.g, p.r, p.i, p.z
    FROM photoObj p
    JOIN dbo.fGetNearbyObjEq(153.378,-0.85,9) n ON n.objID = p.objID
    WHERE
        p.type = 3 
        and p.r BETWEEN 13 and 18 
        and p.g-p.r BETWEEN 0.6 and 1
</pre>
</font></p>

<p>The query returns 46 objects. Not every galaxy is part of the cluster, but most are.</p> 

<p>Your results will be different, depending on which cluster you chose, what 
criteria you chose, and how big you thought the cluster was. The 
important thing is that you think carefully about how to search for 
galaxies in a cluster, then write a query that reflects your thinking.</p>
